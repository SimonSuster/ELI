2	4274965	younger adults	Subjective and physiological stress levels showed no age difference and no detrimental association with prospective memory. TITLE: Adult age differences in prospective memory in the laboratory: are they related to higher stress levels in the elderly?     ABSTRACT.  To explain age deficits found in laboratory-based prospective memory (prospective memory) tasks, it has recently been suggested that the testing situation per se may be more stressful for older adults, thereby impairing their performance. To test this assumption, subjective and physiological stress levels were assessed at several times during the experiment in 33 younger and 29 older adults. In addition, half of participants were randomized in a condition where they completed a relaxation intervention before performing a time-based prospective memory task. Results confirmed the age deficit in laboratory prospective memory. The intervention successfully reduced stress levels in both age groups but had no effect on prospective memory or the age deficit. In conclusion, data suggest that age deficits usually observed in laboratory prospective memory may not be due to higher stress levels in the older adults.

TITLE: Better Glasgow outcome score, cerebral perfusion pressure and focal brain oxygenation in severely traumatized brain following direct regional brain hypothermia therapy: A prospective randomized study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Induced hypothermia for treatment of traumatic brain injury is controversial. Since many pathways involved in the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury are temperature dependent, regional brain hypothermia is thought capable to mitigate those processes. The objectives of this study are to assess the therapeutic effects and complications of regional brain cooling in severe head injury with Glasgow coma scale (Glasgow coma scale) 6-7.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  A prospective randomized controlled pilot study involving patients with severe traumatic brain injury with Glasgow coma scale 6 and 7 who required decompressive craniectomy. Patients were randomized into two groups: Cooling and no cooling. For the cooling group, analysis was made by dividing the group into mild and deep cooling. Brain was cooled by irrigating the brain continuously with cold Hartmann solution for 24-48 h. Main outcome assessments were a dichotomized Glasgow outcome score (Glasgow outcome score) at 6 months posttrauma.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  A total of 32 patients were recruited. The cooling-treated patients did better than no cooling. There were 63.2% of patients in cooling group attained good Glasgow outcome score at 6 months compared to only 15.4% in noncooling group (P = 0.007). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Data from this pilot study imply direct regional brain hypothermia appears safe, feasible and maybe beneficial in treating severely head-injured patients.

2	2720945	cineole	Improvement of lung function, dyspnea and quality of life as multiple criteria were statistically significant relative to placebo. TITLE: Concomitant therapy with Cineole (Eucalyptole) reduces exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A placebo-controlled double-blind trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The clinical effects of mucolytics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are discussed controversially. Cineole is the main constituent of eucalyptus oil and mainly used in inflammatory airway diseases as a mucolytic agent. We hypothesised that its known mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects as concomitant therapy would reduce the exacerbation rate and show benefits on pulmonary function tests as well as quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center-study we randomly assigned 242 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to receive 200 mg of cineole or placebo 3 times daily as concomitant therapy for 6 months during winter-time. The frequency, duration and severity of exacerbations were combined as primary outcome measures for testing as multiple criteria. Secondary outcome measures included changes of lung function, respiratory symptoms and quality of life as well as the single parameters of the exacerbations.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Baseline demographics, lung function and standard medication of both groups were comparable. During the treatment period of 6 months the multiple criteria frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations were significantly lower in the group treated with cineole in comparison to placebo. Secondary outcome measures validated these findings. Adverse events were comparable in both groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Concomitant therapy with cineole reduces exacerbations as well as dyspnea and improves lung function and health status. This study further suggests cineole as an active controller of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by intervening in the pathophysiology of airway inflammation of the mucus membrane.

Secondary outcome measures included changes of lung function, respiratory symptoms and quality of life as well as the single parameters of the exacerbations.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Baseline demographics, lung function and standard medication of both groups were comparable. During the treatment period of 6 months the multiple criteria frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations were significantly lower in the group treated with cineole in comparison to placebo. Secondary outcome measures validated these findings. Adverse events were comparable in both groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Concomitant therapy with cineole reduces exacerbations as well as dyspnea and improves lung function and health status. This study further suggests cineole as an active controller of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by intervening in the pathophysiology of airway inflammation of the mucus membrane.

TITLE: Concomitant therapy with Cineole (Eucalyptole) reduces exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A placebo-controlled double-blind trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The clinical effects of mucolytics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are discussed controversially. Cineole is the main constituent of eucalyptus oil and mainly used in inflammatory airway diseases as a mucolytic agent. We hypothesised that its known mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects as concomitant therapy would reduce the exacerbation rate and show benefits on pulmonary function tests as well as quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center-study we randomly assigned 242 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to receive 200 mg of cineole or placebo 3 times daily as concomitant therapy for 6 months during winter-time.

TITLE: Impact of Health-Promoting Educational Intervention on Lifestyle (Nutrition Behaviors, Physical Activity and Mental Health) Related to Vaginal Health Among Reproductive-Aged Women With Vaginitis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Vaginitis is one of the most common diseases in reproductive-aged women (15 - 49 years of age). Side effects of vaginitis can affect other aspects of health, which could be prevented by promoting a healthy lifestyle related to vaginal health.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  This study aimed at determining the impact of health-promoting educational intervention on lifestyle (nutrition behaviors, physical activities, and mental health) related to vaginal health among reproductive-aged women with vaginitis.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The data set was collected as part of an experimental study conducted on 350 reproductive-aged women with vaginitis. Participants were selected through a stratified two-stage clustered sampling and simple randomization from 10 attending health centers affiliated with Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in five regions (North, South, East, West, and Center) of Kermanshah (a city in western Iran) in 2015. Two clinics in each region were selected; patients from the first center were chosen as the intervention group and patients from the second center made up the control group. To collect data, a questionnaire including socio-demographic and lifestyle questions was used. The questionnaire was designed and validated via the psychometric process. Educational intervention was performed over twenty sessions of 25 to 35 minutes. The intervention group was followed up with face-to-face education, a pamphlet, phone contact, and by social media. The control group continued the routine treatment without contacting the intervention group. Data were collected from both groups before the intervention and six months after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the SPSS-20 package, using the independent t-test, paired t-test, chi-square test, and analysis of covariance (analysis of covariance) test. The confidence interval was 95% and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Comparing mean differences between the two groups indicated significant difference between them (P < 0.001). Results of the paired t-test in the control group did not show significant changes in lifestyle scores after 6 months (P > 0.05). The independent t-test did not show significant statistical differences between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics (P > 0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  According to the findings, educational intervention is beneficial in promoting three aspects of women's lifestyle related to vaginal health. Therefore, a health-promoting lifestyle seems essential for having a healthy vagina and for preventing vaginitis.

TITLE: Aripiprazole in the Treatment of Irritability in Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Japan: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study    ABSTRACT.  We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents (6–17 years) with autism spectrum disorder (autism spectrum disorder) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study in Japan. Patients received flexibly dosed aripiprazole (1–15 mg/day) or placebo. Ninety-two patients were randomized to placebo (n = 45) or aripiprazole (n = 47). Aripiprazole produced a significant improvement in the mean parent/caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Japanese Version irritability subscale score relative to placebo from week 3 through week 8. Administration of aripiprazole provided significantly greater improvement in the mean clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores than placebo from week 2 through week 8. Three patients in placebo group discontinued. Aripiprazole was effective and generally safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder in Japanese children and adolescents.

TITLE: Effects of Clonidine Premedication Upon Postoperative Shivering and Recovery Time in Patients With and Without Opium Addiction After Elective Leg Fracture Surgeries    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Opium is a highly addictive agent and the most common narcotic often misused in Iran. The pharmacokinetic of anesthetic drugs in patients with opium addiction is one of the great challenges for anesthesiologists. Hemodynamic instability and postoperative side effects are of these challenges which should be managed correctly.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  In this study we aimed to assess the effects of clonidine upon post anesthesia shivering and recovery time in patients with and without opium addiction after general anesthesia to decrease the subsequent complications related to the shivering and elongation of recovery time.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  In a randomized clinical trial, 160 patients candidates for elective leg fracture operations under general anesthesia were studied in four groups of 40 patients: Group 1 (placebo 1) were patients without addiction who got placebo 90 minutes before the operation. Group 2 (placebo 2) were patients with opium addiction which received placebo as group 1. Group 3 (Clonidine 1) patients without addiction who got clonidine 90 minutes before the operation and group 4 (Clonidine 2) who were opium addicted ones which received clonidine as premedication.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Recovery time in clonidine groups of patients with and without addiction was less than placebo ones (both P < 0.01) which the magnitude of difference was higher in opium addicted than non-addicted patients (P = 0.04).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS. Premedication with clonidine in patients with and without opium addiction can be effective to decrease the incidence of shivering and recovery time after operation.

Hemodynamic instability and postoperative side effects are of these challenges which should be managed correctly.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  In this study we aimed to assess the effects of clonidine upon post anesthesia shivering and recovery time in patients with and without opium addiction after general anesthesia to decrease the subsequent complications related to the shivering and elongation of recovery time.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  In a randomized clinical trial, 160 patients candidates for elective leg fracture operations under general anesthesia were studied in four groups of 40 patients: Group 1 (placebo 1) were patients without addiction who got placebo 90 minutes before the operation. Group 2 (placebo 2) were patients with opium addiction which received placebo as group 1. Group 3 (Clonidine 1) patients without addiction who got clonidine 90 minutes before the operation and group 4 (Clonidine 2) who were opium addicted ones which received clonidine as premedication.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  None of the patients with and without addiction in clonidine groups had shivering after the operation but in placebo groups shivering was observed and the difference between clonidine and placebo groups was statistically significant (P < 0.01). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS. Premedication with clonidine in patients with and without opium addiction can be effective to decrease the incidence of shivering and recovery time after operation.
2	4793173	Sodium nitroprusside 100 nmol/ml	All concentrations of sodium nitroprusside used was found to increase motility and viability of spermatozoa at 1, 2 and 3 hours after thawing, significantly (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference at zero time. TITLE: Effects of Adding Sodium Nitroprusside to Semen Diluents on Motility, Viability and Lipid Peroxidation of Sperm in Holstein Bulls    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Nitric oxide (Nitric oxide) that plays important role in all sexual activities of animals is made from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzymatic action of Nitric oxide synthase (NO synthase). Nitric oxide makes a band with sulfur-iron complexes, but due to production of steroid sexual hormones related to the enzymes involved in this complex, Nitric oxide can change the activity of these enzymes.  Nitric oxide affects many cells including vein endothelial cells, macrophages and mast cells. These cells are also found in Leydig cells; therefore, they are important source of Nitric oxide in testis tissue.  Therefore, minimizing damages to sperm at the time of freezing thawing process are really important. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate Nitric oxide concentration to be added to the freezing extender to improve the quality of thawed sperm.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.  In this experimental randomized study, sperms of four Holstein bulls with an average age of 4 were collected twice a week for 3 weeks. They received sodium nitroprusside (sodium nitroprusside) in concentrations of 0, 10, 50 and 100 nmol/ml. Data analysis was performed using the special issue and static (special issue and static) 98 software. Also, mean comparison was done using Duncan's multiple ranges test (P<0.05).This research was conducted at the laboratory of Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran at spring and summer of 2013.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Different concentrations of sodium nitroprusside reduced the membrane lipid peroxidation level of sperm and increased acrosome membranes integrity, implying that sodium nitroprusside generally improved samples membranes, especially in 50 and 100 nmol/ml concentrations.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  According to the obtained results, addition of sodium nitroprusside to semen diluents increases motility and viability of spermatozoa. Also, it reduces membrane lipid peroxidation level that leads to improved sperm function.

2	4524824	Colorectal anastomosis without leakage	None of the animals showed signs of illness 48 hours after the intraperitoneal gastrostomy tube placement. TITLE: Early Diagnosis of Colonic Anastomotic Leak With Peritoneal Endoscopy    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:.  At present, we do not have a reliable method for the early diagnosis of colorectal anastomotic leakage (anastomotic leakage). We tested peritoneal flexible endoscopy through a port placed in the abdominal wall in the early postoperative course, as a new diagnostic method for detection of this complication and evaluated the suggested method for safety, feasibility, and accuracy.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Ten swine were randomized into 2 groups: group A, colorectal anastomosis without leakage; and group B, colorectal anastomosis with leakage. A button gastrostomy feeding tube was inserted percutaneously into the peritoneal cavity. Colorectal anastomosis (with or without defect) was created 48 hours after the first operation. The swine were examined by peritoneal flexible endoscopy 8 and 24 hours after the colonic operation, by a consultant surgeon who was blinded to both the presence and the allocated location of the of the anastomotic defect.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  More than half of the anastomosis circumference was identified in 60 and 10% of the animals at endoscopy 8 and 24 hours, respectively, after the anastomosis was created. Excessive adhesion formation was observed in all animals, irrespective of anastomotic leakage. The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopy in detecting peritonitis 24 hours after anastomotic leakage were both 60%.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Peritoneal endoscopy is a safe and simple procedure. Visualization of the peritoneal cavity in the early postoperative course was limited due to adhesion formation. Further studies are needed to clarify the accuracy of the procedure and to address additional methodological concerns.

TITLE: Randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and usability of a computerised phone-based lifestyle coaching system for primary and secondary prevention of stroke    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  One of the most effective current approaches to preventing stroke events is the reduction of lifestyle risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and usability of the phone-based Computer-aided Prevention System (Computer-aided Prevention System) in supporting the reduction of lifestyle-related risk factors.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A single-centre two-arm clinical trial was performed between January 2013 and February 2014, based on individual follow-up periods of six months with 94 patients at high risk of stroke, randomly assigned to an intervention group (IC: 48; advised to use the Computer-aided Prevention System system) or a standard care group (SC: 46). Study parameters, such as blood pressure, blood values (HDL, LDL, HbA1c, glycaemia and triglycerides), weight, height, physical activity as well as nutrition and smoking habits were captured through questionnaires and medical records at baseline and post-intervention and analysed to detect significant changes. The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (System Usability Scale) complemented by a more system-specific user satisfaction and feedback questionnaire.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Furthermore, we detected a statistically significant increase in self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption (pseudo-median of the differences = 5.4 servings/week; p = 0.04; 95 % CI = [0.5, 10.5]) and a decrease in sweets consumption (pseudo-median of the differences = –2 servings/week; p = 0.04; 95 % CI = [–4, –0.00001]) in the intervention group. The usability assessment showed that the Computer-aided Prevention System system was, in general, highly accepted by the users (average System Usability Scale score: 80.1).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The study provided encouraging results indicating that a computerised phone-based lifestyle coaching system, such as Computer-aided Prevention System, can support the usual treatment in reducing cerebro-cardiovascular risk factors and that such an approach is well applicable in practice.

The usability assessment showed that the Computer-aided Prevention System system was, in general, highly accepted by the users (average System Usability Scale score: 80.1).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The study provided encouraging results indicating that a computerised phone-based lifestyle coaching system, such as Computer-aided Prevention System, can support the usual treatment in reducing cerebro-cardiovascular risk factors and that such an approach is well applicable in practice.

TITLE: Randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and usability of a computerised phone-based lifestyle coaching system for primary and secondary prevention of stroke    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  One of the most effective current approaches to preventing stroke events is the reduction of lifestyle risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and smoking. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and usability of the phone-based Computer-aided Prevention System (Computer-aided Prevention System) in supporting the reduction of lifestyle-related risk factors.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A single-centre two-arm clinical trial was performed between January 2013 and February 2014, based on individual follow-up periods of six months with 94 patients at high risk of stroke, randomly assigned to an intervention group (IC: 48; advised to use the Computer-aided Prevention System system) or a standard care group (SC: 46). Study parameters, such as blood pressure, blood values (HDL, LDL, HbA1c, glycaemia and triglycerides), weight, height, physical activity as well as nutrition and smoking habits were captured through questionnaires and medical records at baseline and post-intervention and analysed to detect significant changes. The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (System Usability Scale) complemented by a more system-specific user satisfaction and feedback questionnaire.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The statistical evaluation of primary measures revealed significant decreases of systolic blood pressure (mean of the differences = –9 mmHg; p = 0.03; 95 % CI = [–17.29, –0.71]), LDL (pseudo-median of the differences = –7.9 mg/dl; p = 0.04; 95 % CI = [–18.5, –0.5]) and triglyceride values (pseudo-median of the differences = –12.5 mg/dl; p = 0.04; 95 % CI = [–26, –0.5]) in the intervention group, while no such changes could be observed in the control group.

2	5360580	1 mg/day of Plasmalogens purified from scallop	Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease showed a significantly greater decrease in plasma PlsPE in the placebo group than in the treatment group.   TITLE: Efficacy and Blood Plasmalogen Changes by Oral Administration of Plasmalogen in Patients with Mild Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Plasmalogens (Plasmalogens) reportedly decreased in postmortem brain and in the blood of patients with Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease). Recently we showed that intraperitoneal administration of Plasmalogens improved cognitive function in experimental animals. In the present trial, we tested the efficacy of oral administration of scallop-derived purified Plasmalogens with respect to cognitive function and blood Plasmalogens changes in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24 weeks. Participants were 328 patients aged 60 to 85 years who had 20 to 27 points in Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese (Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese) score and five or less points in Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese). They were randomized to receive either 1 mg/day of Plasmalogens purified from scallop or placebo. The patients and study physicians were masked to the assignment. The primary outcome was MMSE-J. The secondary outcomes included Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Version-Japanese and concentration of phosphatidyl ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsPE) in erythrocyte membrane and plasma. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000014945.   ABSTRACT.FINDINGS.  Of 328 patients enrolled, 276 patients completed the trial (140 in the treatment group and 136 in the placebo group). In an intention-to-treat analysis including both mild Alzheimer's disease (20 ≤ Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese ≤ 23) and mild cognitive impairment (24 ≤ Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese ≤ 27), no significant difference was shown between the treatment and placebo groups in the primary and secondary outcomes, with no severe adverse events in either group. In mild Alzheimer's disease patients, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised improved significantly in the treatment group, and the between group difference was nearly significant (P = 0.067). In a subgroup analysis of mild Alzheimer's disease patients, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised significantly improved among females and those aged below 77 years in the treatment group, and the between-group differences were statistically significant in females (P = 0.017) and in those aged below 77 years (P = 0.029).

2	4984426	Buccal buprenorphine (BBUP)	There were no significant differences in pain ratings between treatments. TITLE: Evaluation of the Tolerability of Switching Patients on Chronic Full μ-Opioid Agonist Therapy to Buccal Buprenorphine    ABSTRACT.  Objective Assess whether patients with chronic pain receiving 80 to 220 mg oral morphine sulfate equivalent of a full μ-opioid agonist could be transitioned to buccal buprenorphine at approximately 50% of their full dose without inducing opioid withdrawal or sacrificing analgesic efficacy.   Methods. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in adult patients receiving around-the-clock full opioid agonist therapy and confirmed to be opioid dependent by naloxone challenge. Study doses were substituted at the time of the regular dose schedule for each patient. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score ≥ 13 (moderate withdrawal) or use of rescue medication.   Results. 35 subjects on ≥ 80 mg morphine sulfate equivalent per day were evaluable for opioid withdrawal. One patient during buccal buprenorphine treatment and two during 50% full μ-opioid agonist treatment experienced opioid withdrawal of at least moderate intensity. The mean maximum Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores were similar, and numerically lower on buccal buprenorphine. The most frequent adverse events with buccal buprenorphine were headache (19%), vomiting (13%), nausea, diarrhea, and drug withdrawal syndrome (each 9%), and with full μ-opioid agonist were headache (16%), drug withdrawal syndrome (13%), and nausea (6%).   Conclusions. Chronic pain patients treated with around-the-clock full μ-opioid agonist therapy can be switched to buccal buprenorphine (a partial μ-opioid agonist) at approximately 50% of the full μ-opioid agonist dose without an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or loss of pain control.

TITLE: Aerobic Physical Exercise Improved the Cognitive Function of Elderly Males but Did Not Modify Their Blood Homocysteine Levels    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Physical exercise influences homocysteine (homocysteine) concentrations, cognitive function and the metabolic profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of regular physical exercise on homocysteine levels, the metabolic profile and cognitive function in healthy elderly males before and after an endurance exercise program.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty-five healthy and sedentary volunteers were randomized into 2 groups: (1) a control group asked not to change their normal everyday activities and not to start any regular physical exercise program and (2) an experimental group trained at a heart rate intensity corresponding to ventilatory threshold 1 (ventilatory threshold 1) for 60 min/day 3 times weekly on alternate days for 6 months using a cycle ergometer. All volunteers underwent cognitive evaluations, blood sample analyses and ergospirometric assessments.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in the experimental group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The data suggest that a physical exercise program does not reduce homocysteine levels in healthy elderly males, although it improves the cardiovascular and metabolic profile as well as cognitive function.

TITLE: Aerobic Physical Exercise Improved the Cognitive Function of Elderly Males but Did Not Modify Their Blood Homocysteine Levels    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Physical exercise influences homocysteine (homocysteine) concentrations, cognitive function and the metabolic profile. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of regular physical exercise on homocysteine levels, the metabolic profile and cognitive function in healthy elderly males before and after an endurance exercise program.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty-five healthy and sedentary volunteers were randomized into 2 groups: (1) a control group asked not to change their normal everyday activities and not to start any regular physical exercise program and (2) an experimental group trained at a heart rate intensity corresponding to ventilatory threshold 1 (ventilatory threshold 1) for 60 min/day 3 times weekly on alternate days for 6 months using a cycle ergometer. All volunteers underwent cognitive evaluations, blood sample analyses and ergospirometric assessments.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A significant improvement in cognitive function was observed in the experimental group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.

2	3179931	fecal occult blood test plus a mailed reminder	At 6 months after card distribution, 64.6% patients in the intervention group returned fecal occult blood test cards compared with 48.4% in the control group (P < 0.001). TITLE: Cost-effectiveness of a mailed educational reminder to increase colorectal cancer screening    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Colorectal cancer (Colorectal cancer) screening rates are low in many areas and cost-effective interventions to promote Colorectal cancer screening are needed. Recently in a randomized controlled trial, a mailed educational reminder increased Colorectal cancer screening rates by 16.2% among U.S. Veterans. The aim of our study was to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of a mailed educational reminder on fecal occult blood test (fecal occult blood test) adherence.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In a blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 769 patients were randomly assigned to the usual care group (fecal occult blood test alone, n = 382) or the intervention group (fecal occult blood test plus a mailed reminder, n = 387). Ten days after picking up the fecal occult blood test cards, a 1-page reminder with information related to Colorectal cancer screening was mailed to the intervention group. Primary outcome was number of returned fecal occult blood test cards after 6 months. The costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) of the intervention were assessed and calculated respectively. Sensitivity analyses were based on varying costs of labor and supplies.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The total cost of the intervention was $962 or $2.49 per patient, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $15 per additional person screened for Colorectal cancer. Sensitivity analysis based on a 10% cost variation was $13.50 to $16.50 per additional patient screened for Colorectal cancer.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  A simple mailed educational reminder increases fecal occult blood test card return rate at a cost many health care systems can afford. Compared to other patient-directed interventions (telephone, letters from physicians, mailed reminders) for Colorectal cancer screening, our intervention was more effective and cost-effective.

TITLE: Thyroid cancer patient perceptions of radioactive iodine treatment choice: Follow‐up from a decision‐aid randomized trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Patient decision aids (Patient decision aids) inform medical decision making, but longer term effects are unknown. This article describes extended follow‐up from a thyroid cancer treatment P‐DA trial.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this single‐center, parallel‐design randomized controlled trial conducted at a Canadian tertiary/quaternary care center, early‐stage thyroid cancer patients from a P‐DA trial were contacted 15 to 23 months after randomization/radioactive iodine (randomization/radioactive iodine) decision making to evaluate longer term outcomes. It was previously reported that the use of the computerized P‐DA in thyroid cancer patients considering postsurgical randomization/radioactive iodine treatment significantly improved medical knowledge in comparison with usual care alone. The P‐DA and control groups were compared for the following outcomes: feeling informed about the randomization/radioactive iodine treatment choice, decision satisfaction, decision regret, cancer‐related worry, and physician trust. In a subgroup of 20 participants, in‐depth interviews were conducted for a qualitative analysis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Ninety‐five percent (70 of 74) of the original population enrolled in follow‐up at a mean of 17.1 months after randomization. There were no significant group differences in decision satisfaction (P = .142), decision regret (P = .199), cancer‐related worry (P = .645), mood (P = .211), or physician trust (P = .764). In the qualitative analysis, the P‐DA was perceived to have increased patient knowledge and confidence in decision making.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The P‐DA improved cancer survivors' actual and long‐term perceived medical knowledge with no adverse effects. More research on the long‐term outcomes of P‐DA use is needed.

2	4793655	Attractive cuing	However, the rate of improvement was greater for attractive versus repulsive cuing.   TITLE: The effects of attractive vs. repulsive instructional cuing on balance performance    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Torso-based vibrotactile feedback has been shown to improve postural performance during quiet and perturbed stance in healthy young and older adults and individuals with balance impairments. These systems typically include tactors distributed around the torso that are activated when body motion exceeds a predefined threshold. Users are instructed to "move away from the vibration". However, recent studies have shown that in the absence of instructions, vibrotactile stimulation induces small (~1°) non-volitional responses in the direction of its application location. It was hypothesized that an attractive cuing strategy (i.e., "move toward the vibration") could improve postural performance by leveraging this natural tendency.   ABSTRACT.FINDINGS.  Eight healthy older adults participated in two non-consecutive days of computerized dynamic posturography testing while wearing a vibrotactile feedback system comprised of an inertial measurement unit and four tactors that were activated in pairs when body motion exceeded 1° anteriorly or posteriorly. A crossover design was used. On each day participants performed 24 repetitions of Sensory Organization Test condition 5 (Sensory Organization Test condition 5), three repetitions each of SOT 1–6, three repetitions of the Motor Control Test, and five repetitions of the Adaptation Test. Performance metrics included A/P RMS, Time-in-zone and 95 % CI Ellipse. Performance improved with both cuing strategies but participants performed better when using repulsive cues. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The results suggest that when the cutaneous signal is interpreted as an alarm, cognition overrides sensory information. Furthermore, although repulsive cues resulted in better performance, attractive cues may be as good, if not better, than repulsive cues following extended training.

TITLE: Early Diagnosis of    ABSTRACT.   Aims. To investigate H. pylori infection rate and evaluate a combined set of tests for H. pylori diagnosis in Vietnamese patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding (peptic ulcer bleeding). Methods. Consecutive patients with acute PUB were enrolled prospectively. Rapid urease test (Rapid urease test) with 3 biopsies was carried out randomly. Patients without Rapid urease test or with negative Rapid urease test received urea breath test (urea breath test) and serological and urinary H. pylori antibody tests. H. pylori was considered positive if Rapid urease test or any noninvasive test was positive. Patients were divided into group A (Rapid urease test plus noninvasive tests) and group B (only noninvasive tests). Results. The overall H. pylori infection rate was 94.2% (161/171). Groups A and B had no differences in demographic characteristics, bleeding severity, endoscopic findings, and proton pump inhibitor use. The positive rate of Rapid urease test was similar at each biopsy site but significantly increased if Rapid urease test results from 2 or 3 sites were combined (p < 0.05). Conclusions. H. pylori infection rate in Vietnamese patients with acute PUB is high. Rapid urease test is an excellent test if at least 2 biopsies are taken.

TITLE: Household costs for personal protection against mosquitoes: secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial of dengue prevention in Guerrero state, Mexico    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Dengue is a serious public health issue that affects households in endemic areas in terms of health and also economically, imposing costs for prevention and treatment of cases. The Camino Verde cluster-randomised controlled trial in Mexico and Nicaragua assessed the impact of evidence-based community engagement in dengue prevention. The Mexican arm of the trial was conducted in 90 randomly selected communities in three coastal regions of Guerrero State. This study reports an analysis of a secondary outcome of the trial: household use of and expenditure on anti-mosquito products. We examined whether the education and mobilisation activities of the trial motivated people to spend less on anti-mosquito products.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  We carried out a household questionnaire survey in the trial communities in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (5349 households in intervention clusters, 5142 households in control clusters), including questions about socio-economic status, self-reported dengue illness, and purchase of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products in the previous month. We examined expenditures on anti-mosquito products at baseline in relation to social vulnerability and we compared use of and expenditures on these products between intervention and control clusters in 2012.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In 2010, 44.2% of 12,312 households reported using anti-mosquito products, with a mean expenditure of USD4.61 per month among those who used them. Socially vulnerable households spent less on the products. The mean expenditure on the products, among those households who bought them, was USD6.43; 30.4% in the intervention clusters and 36.7% in the control clusters spent more than this (difference − 0.06, 95% CIca −0.12 to −0.01). These expenditures on anti-mosquito products represent 3.3% and 3.8% respectively of monthly household income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.

We examined whether the education and mobilisation activities of the trial motivated people to spend less on anti-mosquito products.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  We carried out a household questionnaire survey in the trial communities in 2010 (12,312 households) and 2012 (5349 households in intervention clusters, 5142 households in control clusters), including questions about socio-economic status, self-reported dengue illness, and purchase of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products in the previous month. We examined expenditures on anti-mosquito products at baseline in relation to social vulnerability and we compared use of and expenditures on these products between intervention and control clusters in 2012.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In 2010, 44.2% of 12,312 households reported using anti-mosquito products, with a mean expenditure of USD4.61 per month among those who used them. Socially vulnerable households spent less on the products. The mean expenditure on the products, among those households who bought them, was USD6.43; 30.4% in the intervention clusters and 36.7% in the control clusters spent more than this (difference − 0.06, 95% CIca −0.12 to −0.01). These expenditures on anti-mosquito products represent 3.3% and 3.8% respectively of monthly household income for the poorest 10% of the population in 2012.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The Camino Verde community mobilisation intervention, as well as being effective in reducing dengue infections, was effective in reducing household use of and expenditure on insecticide anti-mosquito products.

2	3893543	listened to Mozart K.448 daily before bedtime for at least six months	Significant decreases in epileptiform discharges were also observed after 1, 2, and 6 months of listening to Mozart K.448 when compared with EEGs before listening to music. TITLE: Mozart K.448 listening decreased seizure recurrence and epileptiform discharges in children with first unprovoked seizures: a randomized controlled study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Increasing numbers of reports show the beneficial effects of listening to Mozart music in decreasing epileptiform discharges as well as seizure frequency in epileptic children. There has been no effective method to reduce seizure recurrence after the first unprovoked seizure until now. In this study, we investigated the effect of listening to Mozart K.448 in reducing the seizure recurrence rate in children with first unprovoked seizures.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty-eight children who experienced their first unprovoked seizure with epileptiform discharges were included in the study. They were randomly placed into treatment (n = 24) and control (n = 24) groups. Children in the treatment group listened to Mozart K.448 daily before bedtime for at least six months. Two patients in the treatment group were excluded from analysis due to discontinuation intervention. Finally, forty-six patients were analyzed. Most of these patients (89.1%) were idiopathic in etiology. Seizure recurrence rates and reduction of epileptiform discharges were compared.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The average follow-up durations in the treatment and control groups were 18.6 ± 6.6 and 20.1 ± 5.1 months, respectively. The seizure recurrence rate was estimated to be significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group over 24 months (37.2% vs. 76.8%, p = 0.0109). There were no significant differences in gender, mentality, seizure type, and etiology between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Although the case number was limited and control music was not performed in this study, the study revealed that listening to Mozart K.448 reduced the seizure recurrence rate and epileptiform discharges in children with first unprovoked seizures, especially of idiopathic etiology. We believe that Mozart K.448 could be a promising alternative treatment in patients with first unprovoked seizures and abnormal EEGs. Further large-scaled study should be conducted to confirm the effect.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  NCT01892605, date: June-19-2013

TITLE: Clinical Relevance of Vilazodone Treatment in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder: Categorical Improvement in Symptoms    ABSTRACT.  Objective: To assess clinically relevant symptom improvement in patients with major depressive disorder (major depressive disorder) receiving vilazodone by using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale), a clinician-rated scale used to measure major depressive disorder symptom severity and improvement.   Method: Pooled data from 2 positive, phase 3, 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder were analyzed. Patients received vilazodone 40 mg/d or placebo; post hoc analyses were conducted on study completers. Depression symptom improvement was evaluated by analyzing the proportions of patients who shifted from the baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale single-item symptom severity category of ≥ 2 (mild to severe symptoms) to an end-of-study category < 2 (minimal to no symptoms) or from ≥ 4 (moderate to severe symptoms) to ≤ 2 (mild to no symptoms). The proportion of patients who shifted from anxious depression to no anxious depression was also analyzed.   Results: The percentage of patients who completed these studies with severity category shift from baseline ≥ 2 to end of study < 2 was significantly higher for vilazodone versus placebo on all Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale items (odds ratio [odds ratio] range, 1.4–1.7, P < .05) except reduced appetite (odds ratio = 1.3, P = .232). Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of vilazodone-treated versus placebo-treated patients shifted from anxious depression at baseline to no anxious depression at end of study (odds ratio = 1.5, P = .031).   Conclusions: These results suggest that vilazodone treatment is associated with clinically relevant changes in depression symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder.

TITLE: Efficacy of single-injection unilateral thoracic paravertebral block for post open cholecystectomy pain relief: a prospective randomized study at Gondar University Hospital    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Cholecystectomy can be associated with considerable postoperative pain. While the benefits of paravertebral block (paravertebral block) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of paravertebral block on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic paravertebral block reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Of 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.   ABSTRACT.RESULT.  The main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (Numerical Rating Scale) pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, 0–10), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, Numerical Rating Scale at rest was 4 (3–6) vs 5 (5–7) and at movement 4 (4–7) vs 6 (5–7.5) for the paravertebral block and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P<0.05). After surgery, the median (25th–75th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the paravertebral block group in statistically significant fashion (P<0.0001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS.  Single-shot thoracic paravertebral block as a component of multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.

2	5863632	Training + coaching	Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: a significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up. TITLE: Efficacy of the Aussie Optimism Program: Promoting Pro-social Behavior and Preventing Suicidality in Primary School Students. A Randomised-Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.  The efficacy of an enhanced version of the Aussie Optimism Program (Aussie Optimism Program) was investigated in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Grade 6 students aged 10–11 years of age (N = 2288) from 63 government primary schools in Perth, Western Australia, participated in the pre, post, and follow-up study. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders, and total difficulties were reported. These findings suggest that the Aussie Optimism Program with teacher training along with coaching may have the potential to positively impact on suicidality and pro-social behavior in the pre-adolescent years.

2	2908852	Intravitreal triamcinolone Acetonide	intraocular pressure in the intravitreal injection group was significantly higher than in the posterior subtenon injection group at 3 months after injection.   TITLE: Intravitreal versus Posterior Subtenon Injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide for Diabetic Macular Edema    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To compare the short-term effects of intravitreal versus posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide for diabetic macular edema.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This is a prospective and interventional study. Sixty eyes of 60 patients who had diffuse diabetic macular edema were assigned to receive a single intravitreal injection (4 mg) or a single posterior subtenon injection (40 mg) of triamcinolone acetonide. The central retinal thickness was measured using optical coherent tomography before injection and at 1 and 3 months after injection. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure) were also measured.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Both intravitreal and posterior subtenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide resulted in significant improvements in visual acuity at 1 month and 3 months after injection. Both groups resulted in a significant decrease in central macular thickness (central macular thickness) at 1 month and 3 months post-injection. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide had a comparable effect to the intravitreal triamcinolone injection and showed a lower risk of elevated intraocular pressure.

TITLE: Intravitreal versus Posterior Subtenon Injection of Triamcinolone Acetonide for Diabetic Macular Edema    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To compare the short-term effects of intravitreal versus posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide for diabetic macular edema.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This is a prospective and interventional study. Sixty eyes of 60 patients who had diffuse diabetic macular edema were assigned to receive a single intravitreal injection (4 mg) or a single posterior subtenon injection (40 mg) of triamcinolone acetonide. The central retinal thickness was measured using optical coherent tomography before injection and at 1 and 3 months after injection. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure) were also measured.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Both intravitreal and posterior subtenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide resulted in significant improvements in visual acuity at 1 month and 3 months after injection. Both groups resulted in a significant decrease in central macular thickness (central macular thickness) at 1 month and 3 months post-injection. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide had a comparable effect to the intravitreal triamcinolone injection and showed a lower risk of elevated intraocular pressure. Posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be a good alternative for the treatment of diffuse diabetic macular edema.

2	4555141	Micronutrient Supplementation	In 2012, a subsample of 184 children from the original cohort (now aged 36–48 months) was randomly selected to participate in a follow-up trial and was assessed for intelligence, working memory, inhibition, and executive function. The tests showed no significant differences between the supplementation groups though there were some gender differences, with girls displaying higher scores than boys across both groups on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) Verbal IQ sentences subtest, the Day-Night cognitive test and on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment) social competency, and boys scoring higher than girls in problem behaviour. TITLE: The Long Term Impact of Micronutrient Supplementation during Infancy on Cognition and Executive Function Performance in Pre-School Children    ABSTRACT.  Brain growth and development are critically dependent on several micronutrients. During early development cellular activity may be sensitive to micronutrient deficiencies, however the evidence from human studies is equivocal. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term cognitive and social-emotional effects of multiple micronutrient supplementation compared with iron supplementation alone, administered during infancy. This study was a follow-up to an initial randomized, double-blind controlled trial (randomized, double-blind controlled trial) in 2010 in which 902 infants, aged 6–17 months, from Lima, Peru, were given daily supplements of either iron (Fe) or multiple micronutrients (multiple micronutrients) including zinc (451 in each group). The supplementation period for both groups was six months. The results indicate that multiple micronutrients supplementation had no long term additional effects on cognitive function compared with iron supplementation alone. The timing of supplement administration for maximum impact on a child's cognitive development requires further investigation.

TITLE: Preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting: Rest your head and close your eyes?     ABSTRACT.  Although opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (opioid-induced nausea and vomiting) is common and debilitating, its mechanism is still unclear. Recently, we suggested that opioids affect semicircular canal function and that this leads to a mismatch between canal input and other sensory information during head motion, which triggers opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. Here, we assess if visual input is relevant for this mismatch. In a randomized-controlled crossover study 14 healthy men (26.9±3.4 years, mean±SD) were tested twice, once blindfolded and once with eyes open, with at least one-day washout. The opioid remifentanil was administered intravenously (0.15 μg/kg/min) for 60 minutes. After a thirty-minutes resting period, subjects' head and trunk were passively moved. Nausea was rated before remifentanil start (T0), before the movement intervention (T30) and after 60 minutes (T60) of administration. Movement triggered nausea independently of visual input (nausea rating 1.5/3.0 (median/interquartile range) in the blindfolded, 2.5/6 in the eyes-open condition, χ2(1) = 1.3, p = 0.25). As movement exacerbates opioid-induced nausea and vomiting independently of visual input, a clash between visual and semicircular canal information is not the relevant trigger for opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. To prevent opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, emphasis should be put on head-rest, eye-closure is less important.

TITLE:  For Whom Does It Work? Moderators of Outcome on the Effect of a Transdiagnostic Internet-Based Maintenance Treatment After Inpatient Psychotherapy: Randomized Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Recent studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of Internet-based maintenance treatments for mental disorders. However, it is still unclear which participants might or might not profit from this particular kind of treatment delivery.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The study aimed to identify moderators of treatment outcome in a transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment (transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment) offered to patients after inpatient psychotherapy for mental disorders in routine care.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Using data from a randomized controlled trial (N=400) designed to test the effectiveness of transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment, we performed secondary analyses to identify factors moderating the effects of transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment (intervention) when compared with those of a treatment-as-usual control condition. transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment involved an online self-management module, asynchronous patient–therapist communication, a peer support group, and online-based progress monitoring. Participants in the control condition had unstructured access to outpatient psychotherapy, standardized outpatient face-to-face continuation treatment, and psychotropic management. Self-reports of psychopathological symptoms and potential moderators were assessed at the start of inpatient treatment (T1), at discharge from inpatient treatment/start of transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment (T2), and at 3-month (T3) and 12-month follow-up (T4).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Education level, positive outcome expectations, and diagnoses significantly moderated intervention versus control differences regarding changes in outcomes between T2 and T3. Only education level moderated change differences between T2 and T4. Simple slope analyses revealed that despite some subgroups benefiting less from the intervention than others, all subgroups still benefited significantly.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment might be suitable for a wide range of participants differing in various clinical, motivational, and demographic characteristics. The treatment is especially effective for participants with low education levels. These findings may generalize to other Internet-based maintenance treatments.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

Drainage of infected fluid is the key to successful treatment, but intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy did not improve outcomes in an earlier, large, randomized trial therapy (Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial [MIST1]).   ABSTRACT.EXPANDED ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrapleural DNase alone, alteplase alone, or the combination of both, to improve pleural drainage.   Design: Multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, 2 × 2 factorial randomized trial.   Setting: Eleven centers in the United Kingdom (United Kingdom).   Subjects: Adult patients (mean age 59 years, 72% men), who had clinical evidence of infection, and pleural fluid that had macroscopic purulence, a positive culture or Gram stain for bacteria, or a pH < 7.2.   Intervention: Patients were assigned to 1 of the 4 study interventions for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tissue plasminogen activator) and DNase, tissue plasminogen activator and placebo, or DNase and placebo.   Outcomes: The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events.   ABSTRACT.EXPANDED ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The change observed with tissue plasminogen activator alone and with DNase alone (-17.2 ± 24.3 and -14.7 ± 16.4%, respectively) was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA-DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.87; P = 0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 9.75; P = 0.01). Combined t-PA-DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, -6.7 days; 95% confidence interval, -12.0 to -1.9; P = 0.006). Hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups.   ABSTRACT.EXPANDED ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Intrapleural t-PA-DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or tissue plasminogen activator alone was ineffective.

Intervention: Patients were assigned to 1 of the 4 study interventions for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tissue plasminogen activator) and DNase, tissue plasminogen activator and placebo, or DNase and placebo.   Outcomes: The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events.   ABSTRACT.EXPANDED ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The change observed with tissue plasminogen activator alone and with DNase alone (-17.2 ± 24.3 and -14.7 ± 16.4%, respectively) was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA-DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.87; P = 0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 9.75; P = 0.01). Combined t-PA-DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, -6.7 days; 95% confidence interval, -12.0 to -1.9; P = 0.006). Hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups.

TITLE: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Varenicline for Smoking Cessation Allowing Flexible Quit Dates    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.  Current smoking cessation guidelines recommend setting a quit date prior to starting pharmacotherapy. However, providing flexibility in the date of quitting may be more acceptable to some smokers. The objective of this study was to compare varenicline 1 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) with placebo in subjects using a flexible quit date paradigm after starting medication.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled international study, smokers of ≥10 cigarettes/day, aged 18–75 years, and who were motivated to quit were randomized (3:1) to receive varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Subjects were followed up through Week 24. Subjects were instructed to quit between Days 8 and 35 after starting medication. The primary endpoint was carbon monoxide–confirmed continuous abstinence during Weeks 9–12, and a key secondary endpoint was continuous abstinence during Weeks 9–24.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Overall, 493 subjects were randomized to varenicline and 166 to placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 1.2% varenicline (none were psychiatric) and 0.6% placebo subjects. Fewer varenicline than placebo subjects reported depression-related adverse events (2.3% vs. 6.7%, respectively).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. using a flexible quit date paradigm had similar efficacy and safety compared with previous fixed quit date studies.

TITLE: Impaired Coronary Endothelial Vasorelaxation in a Preclinical Model of Peripheral Arterial Insufficiency    ABSTRACT.  The present study was designed to determine whether adult swine with peripheral artery insufficiency (peripheral artery insufficiency) would exhibit vascular dysfunction in vessels distinct from the affected distal limbs, the coronary conduit arteries. Moreover, we sought to evaluate the effect of exercise training on coronary vasomotor function in peripheral artery insufficiency. Eighteen female healthy young Yucatan miniature swine were randomly assigned to either occluded exercise trained (occluded exercise trained, n=7), or occluded-sedentary (occluded-sedentary, n=5), or non-occluded, non-exercised control (non-occluded, non-exercised control, n=6) groups. occluded exercise trained pigs were progressively trained by running on a treadmill (5days/week, 12 weeks). The left descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex (left circumflex) coronary arteries were harvested. Vasorelaxation to adenosine diphosphate (adenosine diphosphate), bradykinin (bradykinin), and sodium nitro-prusside (sodium nitro-prusside) were assessed in LAD's; while constrictor responses to phenylephrine (phenylephrine), angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelin-1 (endothelin-1) were assessed in left circumflex's. Vasorelaxation to adenosine diphosphate was reduced in LADs from occluded-sedentary and occluded exercise trained pigs (P<0.001) as compared to non-occluded, non-exercised control pigs; however, occluded exercise trained pigs exhibited partial recovery (P<0.001) intermediate to the other two groups. In addition, sodium nitro-prusside, phenylephrine, Ang II, and endothelin-1 responses were not significantly different among the groups. Our results indicate that 'simple' occlusion of the femoral arteries induces vascular dysfunction in conduit vessels distinct from the affected hindlimbs, as evident in blunted coronary vasorelaxation responses to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin. These findings imply that peripheral artery insufficiency, even in the absence of frank atherogenic vascular disease, contributes to vascular dysfunction in the coronary arteries that could exacerbate disease outcome in patients with peripheral artery disease. Further, regular daily physical activity partially recovered the deficit observed in the coronary arteries.

The left descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex (left circumflex) coronary arteries were harvested. Vasorelaxation to adenosine diphosphate (adenosine diphosphate), bradykinin (bradykinin), and sodium nitro-prusside (sodium nitro-prusside) were assessed in LAD's; while constrictor responses to phenylephrine (phenylephrine), angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelin-1 (endothelin-1) were assessed in left circumflex's. Vasorelaxation to adenosine diphosphate was reduced in LADs from occluded-sedentary and occluded exercise trained pigs (P<0.001) as compared to non-occluded, non-exercised control pigs; however, occluded exercise trained pigs exhibited partial recovery (P<0.001) intermediate to the other two groups. In addition, sodium nitro-prusside, phenylephrine, Ang II, and endothelin-1 responses were not significantly different among the groups. Our results indicate that 'simple' occlusion of the femoral arteries induces vascular dysfunction in conduit vessels distinct from the affected hindlimbs, as evident in blunted coronary vasorelaxation responses to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin. These findings imply that peripheral artery insufficiency, even in the absence of frank atherogenic vascular disease, contributes to vascular dysfunction in the coronary arteries that could exacerbate disease outcome in patients with peripheral artery disease. Further, regular daily physical activity partially recovered the deficit observed in the coronary arteries.

2	3315657	ramosetron group (group R	The number of patients with moderate to severe nausea (20 vs. 10, P = 0.029), and overall incidence of vomiting (13 vs. 5, P = 0.037) were significantly lower in the group RD than in the group R, respectively. TITLE: Efficacy of dexamethasone added to ramosetron for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in highly susceptible patients following spine surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Opioid-based patient controlled analgesia (patient controlled analgesia) provides adequate pain control following spinal surgeries at the expense of increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (postoperative nausea and vomiting). We evaluated the efficacy of dexamethasone added to ramosetron, which is a newly developed five-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 antagonist with a higher receptor affinity and longer action duration compared to its congeners, on preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in highly susceptible patients receiving opioid-based IV patient controlled analgesia after spinal surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  One hundred nonsmoking female patients undergoing spinal surgery were randomly allocated to either a ramosetron group (group R) or a ramosetron plus dexamethasone group (group RD)., Normal saline (1 ml) or 5 mg of dexamethasone was injected before anesthetic induction, while at the end of the surgery, ramosetron (0.3 mg) was administered to all patients and fentanyl-based IV patient controlled analgesia was continued for 48 hrs. The incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain score and the amount of rescue antiemetics were assessed for 48 hours after surgery.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Rescue antiemetic was used less in the RD group without significance.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Combination of ramosetron and dexamethasone significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe nausea and vomiting compared to ramosetron alone in highly susceptible patients receiving opioid-based IV patient controlled analgesia after surgery.

TITLE: Outpatient Foley catheter versus inpatient prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labour: a randomised trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Induction of labour (induction of labour) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery. Outpatient induction of labour is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient induction of labour methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient induction of labour medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (outpatient Foley catheter) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (inpatient vaginal PGE2) for induction of labour (induction of labour) at term.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Women with an unfavourable cervix requiring induction of labour at term (N = 101) were randomised to outpatient care using Foley catheter (outpatient Foley catheter, n = 50) or inpatient care using vaginal PGE2 (inpatient vaginal PGE2, n = 51). outpatient Foley catheter group had Foley catheter inserted and were discharged overnight following a reassuring cardiotocograph. inpatient vaginal PGE2 group received 2 mg/1 mg vaginal PGE2 if nulliparous or 1 mg/1 mg if multiparous. Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  outpatient Foley catheter group had shorter hospital stay prior to birth (21.3 vs. 32.4 hrs, p < .001), inpatient vaginal PGE2 were more likely to achieve vaginal birth within 12 hours of presenting to Birthing Unit (53% vs. 28%, p = .01). outpatient Foley catheter group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin induction of labour (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  outpatient Foley catheter was feasible and acceptable for induction of labour of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to inpatient vaginal PGE2, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin induction of labour.

Main outcome measures were inpatient stay (prior to birth, in Birthing Unit, total), mode of birth, induction to delivery interval, adverse reactions and patient satisfaction.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Vaginal birth rates (66% outpatient Foley catheter Vs. 71% inpatient vaginal PGE2), total induction to delivery time (33.5 hrs vs. 31.3 hrs) and total inpatient times (96 hrs outpatient Foley catheter Vs. 105 hrs inpatient vaginal PGE2) were similar. outpatient Foley catheter group felt less pain (significant discomfort 26% Vs 58%, p = .003), and had more sleep (5.8 Vs 3.4 hours, p < .001), during cervical preparation, but were more likely to require oxytocin induction of labour (88 Vs 59%, p = .001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  outpatient Foley catheter was feasible and acceptable for induction of labour of women with an unfavourable cervix at term compared to inpatient vaginal PGE2, however did not show a statistically significant reduction in total inpatient stay and was associated with increased oxytocin induction of labour.

TITLE: Outpatient Foley catheter versus inpatient prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labour: a randomised trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Induction of labour (induction of labour) is one of the commonest obstetric interventions, with significant impact on both the individual woman and health service delivery. Outpatient induction of labour is an attractive option to reduce these impacts. To date there is little data comparing outpatient and inpatient induction of labour methods, and potential safety concerns (hyperstimulation) if prostaglandins, the standard inpatient induction of labour medications, are used in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to assess feasibility, clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of outpatient Foley catheter (outpatient Foley catheter) vs. inpatient vaginal PGE2 (inpatient vaginal PGE2) for induction of labour (induction of labour) at term.

2	5285426	Robotic surgery	In females, there was no difference between the two groups in any of the components of urological or sexual function. TITLE: Urogenital function in robotic vs laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery: a comparative study    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  Urological and sexual dysfunction are recognised risks of rectal cancer surgery; however, there is limited evidence regarding urogenital function comparing robotic to laparoscopic techniques. The aim of this study was to assess the urogenital functional outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic rectal cancer surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Urological and sexual functions were assessed using gender-specific validated standardised questionnaires. Questionnaires were sent a minimum of 6 months after surgery, and patients were asked to report their urogenital function pre- and post-operatively, allowing changes in urogenital function to be identified. Questionnaires were sent to 158 patients (89 laparoscopy, 69 robotic) of whom 126 (80 %) responded. Seventy-eight (49 male, 29 female) of the responders underwent laparoscopic and 48 (35 male, 13 female) robotic surgery.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Male patients in the robotic group deteriorated less across all components of sexual function and in five components of urological function. Composite male urological and sexual function score changes from baseline were better in the robotic cohort (p < 0.001). However, composite female urological function score change from baseline was better in the robotic group (p = 0.003).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Robotic rectal cancer surgery might offer better post-operative urological and sexual outcomes compared to laparoscopic surgery in male patients and better urological outcomes in females. Larger scale, prospective randomised control studies including urodynamic assessment of urogenital function are required to validate these results.

2	5610004	Training cohort	The concordance index was higher for the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort nomogram than for the TNM staging system (0.67 vs. 0.64, P = 0.01) and higher for the small-cell lung cancer nomogram than for the clinical staging system (limited vs. extensive) (0.60 vs. 0.53, P = 0.12).   TITLE: Development and validation of two prognostic nomograms for predicting survival in patients with non-small cell and small cell lung cancer    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  This study aimed to construct two prognostic nomograms to predict survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (non-small-cell lung cancer) and small-cell lung cancer (small-cell lung cancer) using a novel set of clinical parameters.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  Two nomograms were developed, using a retrospective analysis of 5384 non-small-cell lung cancer and 647 small-cell lung cancer patients seen during a 10-year period at Xiang Ya Affiliated Cancer Hospital (Changsha, China). The patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors needed to establish nomograms for the training cohort. The model was internally validated via bootstrap resampling and externally certified using the validation cohort. Predictive accuracy and discriminatory capability were estimated using concordance index (concordance index), calibration curves, and risk group stratification.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The largest contributor to overall survival (overall survival) prognosis in the non-small-cell lung cancer nomogram was the therapeutic regimen and diagnostic method parameters, and in the small-cell lung cancer nomogram was the therapeutic regimen and health insurance plan parameters. Calibration curves for the nomogram prediction and the actual observation were in optimal agreement for the 3-year overall survival and acceptable agreement for the 5-year overall survival in both training datasets. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Treatment regimen parameter made the largest contribution to overall survival prognosis in both nomograms, and these nomograms might provide clinicians and patients a simple tool that improves their ability to accurately estimate survival based on individual patient parameters rather than using an averaged predefined treatment regimen.

TITLE: Safety and tolerability of virucidal hand rubs: a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial with healthy volunteers    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The hands of the medical staff play an important role in transmission of pathogens in the health care environment. Hand hygiene is efficient, easy to perform and cost-effective. Safety, tolerability and acceptance of hand hygiene preparations play a major role in hand hygiene compliance, and apply, in particular, to formulations with high anti-viral activity.   ABSTRACT.AIM.  Clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different virucidal hand rubs.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In a randomized, double-blind, four-period cross-over trial, healthy volunteers received three different virucidal hand rubs (P1-P3) and a reference product (R) in randomized sequence over a period of 4 days each with a washout period. The primary endpoint was skin barrier function measured by transepidermal water loss (transepidermal water loss) after application.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Twenty-two subjects (seven male, 15 female; median age 25, range 21–54) were randomized and started at least one period. The percentage of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event (adverse event) was 86 % with P1, 25 % with P2, 89 % with P3 and 56 % with R. The majority of adverse events were skin reactions classified as of mild severity. No serious adverse events were observed.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Results were inconsistent. The number of adverse events was higher than expected for all products. In summary, there is room for improvement both for hand rub development and the scientific approaches taken to practically and reproducibly evaluate hand rub safety and tolerability.

The number of adverse events was higher than expected for all products. In summary, there is room for improvement both for hand rub development and the scientific approaches taken to practically and reproducibly evaluate hand rub safety and tolerability.

TITLE: Safety and tolerability of virucidal hand rubs: a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial with healthy volunteers    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The hands of the medical staff play an important role in transmission of pathogens in the health care environment. Hand hygiene is efficient, easy to perform and cost-effective. Safety, tolerability and acceptance of hand hygiene preparations play a major role in hand hygiene compliance, and apply, in particular, to formulations with high anti-viral activity.   ABSTRACT.AIM.  Clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different virucidal hand rubs.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In a randomized, double-blind, four-period cross-over trial, healthy volunteers received three different virucidal hand rubs (P1-P3) and a reference product (R) in randomized sequence over a period of 4 days each with a washout period. The primary endpoint was skin barrier function measured by transepidermal water loss (transepidermal water loss) after application.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Twenty-two subjects (seven male, 15 female; median age 25, range 21–54) were randomized and started at least one period. The percentage of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event (adverse event) was 86 % with P1, 25 % with P2, 89 % with P3 and 56 % with R. The majority of adverse events were skin reactions classified as of mild severity. No serious adverse events were observed.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Results were inconsistent.

TITLE: The effect of     ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The prevalence of Pediatric Functional Constipation (Functional Constipation) has been reported between 0.7% to 29.6%. This study was conducted to compare the laxative effect of cassia fistula emulsion (cassia fistula emulsion) with mineral oil (mineral oil) on Functional Constipation. Cassia fistula is named in Traditional Iranian Medicine (Traditional Iranian Medicine) as "Folus".   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.  A randomized clinical trial was carried on 81 children (age range: 4–13 years) with Functional Constipation, according to Rome III criteria in Amirkola Children's Hospital, Babol, Iran. They received cassia fistula emulsion or mineral oil randomly for three weeks. cassia fistula emulsion was produced according to the order of Traditional Iranian Medicine references. Children were counted as improved when they exited from Rome III criteria of Functional Constipation. Frequency of defecation, fecal incontinence, retentive posturing, severity of pain, consistency of stool and anal leakage of oily material were compared between the two groups and with baselines. An intent-to-treat analysis was used. Safety of drugs was assessed with the evaluation of clinical adverse effects.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  41 children were assigned randomly to receive cassia fistula emulsion and 40 children received mineral oil. After three weeks of medication, 84% of children in cassia fistula emulsion group and 50% in mineral oil group (p = 0.002) exited from the criteria of Functional Constipation, so called improved. All measurable criteria improved in both groups. The severity of pain during defecation and consistency of stool improved significantly better in cassia fistula emulsion group than mineral oil group (p < 0.05), but there were not any significant differences between the two groups in fecal incontinence and retentive posturing. Anal leakage of oily material occurred as an important complication in mineral oil group while the children in cassia fistula emulsion group did not complaint it. Drug's compliances were not significantly different in the two groups. cassia fistula emulsion and mineral oil did not cause clinically significant side effects.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  cassia fistula emulsion was most effective than mineral oil in the 3-week treatment of children with Functional Constipation.

TITLE: Effect of alteplase on the CT hyperdense artery sign and outcome after ischemic stroke    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  To investigate whether the location and extent of the CT hyperdense artery sign (hyperdense artery sign) at presentation affects response to IV alteplase in the randomized controlled Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3).   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  All prerandomization and follow-up (24–48 hours) CT brain scans in IST-3 were assessed for hyperdense artery sign presence, location, and extent by masked raters. We assessed whether hyperdense artery sign grew, persisted, shrank, or disappeared at follow-up, the association with 6-month functional outcome, and effect of alteplase. IST-3 is registered (ISRCTN25765518).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. hyperdense artery sign presence (vs absence) independently predicted poor 6-month outcome (increased Oxford Handicap Scale [Oxford Handicap Scale]) on adjusted ordinal regression analysis (odds ratio [odds ratio] 0.66, p < 0.001). Outcome was worse in patients with more (vs less) extensive hyperdense artery sign (odds ratio 0.61, p = 0.027) but not in proximal (vs distal) hyperdense artery sign (p = 0.420). Increasing age was associated with more hyperdense artery sign growth at follow-up (odds ratio 1.01, p = 0.013). Treatment with alteplase increased hyperdense artery sign shrinkage/disappearance at follow-up (odds ratio 0.77, p = 0.006). There was no interaction between presence vs absence of hyperdense artery sign and benefit of alteplase on 6-month Oxford Handicap Scale (p = 0.167).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  IV alteplase promotes measurable reduction in hyperdense artery sign regardless of hyperdense artery sign location or extent. Alteplase increased independence at 6 months in patients with and without hyperdense artery sign.   ABSTRACT.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:.  This study provides Class I evidence that for patients within 6 hours of ischemic stroke with a CT hyperdense artery sign, IV alteplase reduced intra-arterial hyperdense thrombus.

Increasing age was associated with more hyperdense artery sign growth at follow-up (odds ratio 1.01, p = 0.013). Treatment with alteplase increased hyperdense artery sign shrinkage/disappearance at follow-up (odds ratio 0.77, p = 0.006). There was no interaction between presence vs absence of hyperdense artery sign and benefit of alteplase on 6-month Oxford Handicap Scale (p = 0.167).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  IV alteplase promotes measurable reduction in hyperdense artery sign regardless of hyperdense artery sign location or extent. Alteplase increased independence at 6 months in patients with and without hyperdense artery sign.   ABSTRACT.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE:.  This study provides Class I evidence that for patients within 6 hours of ischemic stroke with a CT hyperdense artery sign, IV alteplase reduced intra-arterial hyperdense thrombus.

2	4881703	Tapentadol	ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. Tapentadol group patients had significantly better analgesia 3 h after the drug and "on coughing" than tramadol group. TITLE: Comparison of tapentadol with tramadol for analgesia after cardiac surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Tapentadol is a relatively new analgesic. We decided to compare it with tramadol for their various effects after cardiac surgery.   ABSTRACT.SETTING:.  A study in a tertiary care hospital.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Sixty adults undergoing cardiac surgery were divided into 2 groups of 30 each by computerized random allotment (Group X = tapentadol 50 mg oral and Group Y = tramadol 100 mg oral). Informed Consent and Institutional Ethics Committee approval were obtained. The patients were given either drug X or drug Y after extubation in this single blinded study, wherein the data collectors and analyzers were blinded to the study. All patients received oral paracetamol qds and either drug X or drug Y tds. The pain score was noted on a Visual Analog Scale before each drug dose, 3 h later and on coughing. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were recorded before the drug dose and 3 h later. Postoperative nausea or vomiting (Postoperative nausea or vomiting), temperature, and modified Glasgow Coma Scale readings were recorded. The above readings were obtained for 6 doses (up to 48 h after extubation).   ABSTRACT.STATISTICS:.  t-test, Pearson Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Mantel–Haenszel test were used for statistics.   The difference in their effects on blood creatinine levels, temperature, hemodynamics, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were not clinically significant. Tapentadol produced lesser drowsiness and lesser vomiting than tramadol.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Tapentadol, due to its norepinephrine reuptake inhibition properties, in addition to mu agonist, is a better analgesic than tramadol and has lesser Postoperative nausea or vomiting.

TITLE: A survey to establish current methods of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in stroke patients practiced by Polish neurologists    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  Venous thromboembolism (Venous thromboembolism) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in stroke patients. The purpose of our survey was to establish the current methods of Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis practiced by Polish neurologists. We also aimed to determine whether there is enough variation in practice to justify the development of an evidence-based guideline for Venous thromboembolism prevention.   ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS.  Postal self-administered questionnaires about Venous thromboembolism prophylactic methods practiced by Polish neurologists were sent to 218 neurological wards where stroke is treated. If no response was received, the questionnaire was faxed and finally we attempted to obtain information by telephone.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  One hundred and seventy-six (80.7%) stroke centers of 218 responded. The majority (137/176; 77.8%) of centers had a stroke unit. The median admission rate of surveyed wards was estimated to be 320 patients/year (range from 20 to 1000 patients/year). The most common method of Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis reported was low molecular weight heparin (low molecular weight heparin) (98.9%), and the least common was intermittent pneumatic compression (intermittent pneumatic compression) (6.8%). All the centers participating in the survey reported a need for a detailed Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The low molecular weight heparin is the predominant Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis strategy for stroke patients practiced by Polish neurologists. Due to the variation of methods used in Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis it might be reasonable to further specify this section of stroke treatment guidelines.

TITLE: Influence of dextran-70 on systemic inflammatory response and myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion following cardiac operations    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  Experimental studies have demonstrated that dextran-70 reduces the leukocyte–endothelium interaction, but clinical evidence is still lacking. Our objective was to justify the anti-inflammatory effect of dextran-70 following cardiac operations.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery (n = 32) or aortic valve replacement (n = 8) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Two groups were formed. In group A (n = 20), dextran-70 infusion was administered at a dose of 7.5 ml/kg before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at a dose of 12.5 ml/kg after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group B served as a control with identical amounts of gelatin infusion (n = 20). The plasma concentration of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, IL 6, IL 6r, IL 8, IL 10, soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cardiac troponin-I and various haemodynamic parameters were measured in the perioperative period. Multivariate methods were used for statistical analysis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In group A, lower peak (median) plasma levels of procalcitonin (0.2 versus 1.4, p < 0.001), IL 8 (5.6 versus 94.8, p < 0.001), IL 10 (47.2 versus 209.7, p = 0.001), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (88.5 versus 130.6, p = 0.033), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (806.7 versus 1,375.7, P = 0.001) and troponin-I (0.22 versus 0.66, p = 0.018) were found. Higher figures of the cardiac index (p = 0.010) along with reduced systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.005) were noted in group A.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Our investigation demonstrated that the use of dextran-70 reduces the systemic inflammatory response and cardiac troponin-I release following cardiac operation.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.

TITLE: Influence of dextran-70 on systemic inflammatory response and myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion following cardiac operations    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  Experimental studies have demonstrated that dextran-70 reduces the leukocyte–endothelium interaction, but clinical evidence is still lacking. Our objective was to justify the anti-inflammatory effect of dextran-70 following cardiac operations.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery (n = 32) or aortic valve replacement (n = 8) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Two groups were formed. In group A (n = 20), dextran-70 infusion was administered at a dose of 7.5 ml/kg before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass and at a dose of 12.5 ml/kg after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Group B served as a control with identical amounts of gelatin infusion (n = 20). The plasma concentration of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, IL 6, IL 6r, IL 8, IL 10, soluble endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cardiac troponin-I and various haemodynamic parameters were measured in the perioperative period. Multivariate methods were used for statistical analysis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  There was no significant difference in IL 6, IL-6r and C-reactive protein values between groups. Higher figures of the cardiac index (p = 0.010) along with reduced systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.005) were noted in group A.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.

On each of the 14 trial days the mean of the gastric pH alteration was significantly higher in omeprazole and pantoprazole suspension-treated patients than in intravenous pantoprazole-treated patients (P < 0.001).   TITLE: The comparison of extemporaneous preparations of omeprazole, pantoprazole oral suspension and intravenous pantoprazole on the gastric pH of critically ill-patients    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Stress-related mucosal disease occurs in many critically ill-patients within 24 h of admission. Proton pump inhibitor therapy has been documented to produce more potent inhibition of gastric acid secretion than histamine 2 receptor antagonists. This study aimed to compare extemporaneous preparations of omeprazole, pantoprazole oral suspension and intravenous (intravenous) pantoprazole on the gastric pH in intensive care unit patients.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This was a randomized single-blind-study. Patients of ≥ 16 years of age with a nasogastric tube, who required mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 h, were eligible for inclusion. The excluded patients were those with active gastrointestinal bleeding, known allergy to omeprazole and pantoprazole and those intolerant to the nasogastric tube. Fifty-six patients were randomized to treatment with omeprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day), pantoprazole suspension 2 mg/ml (40 mg every day) and intravenous pantoprazole (40 mg every day) for up to 14 days. Gastric aspirates were sampled before and 1-2.5 h after the drug administration for the pH measurement using an external pH meter. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 21.0).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Omeprazole and pantoprazole oral suspension are more effective than intravenous pantoprazole in increasing the gastric pH.

TITLE: ACE-inhibition increases podocyte number in experimental glomerular disease independent of proliferation    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The objective of this article is to test the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition on glomerular epithelial cell number in an inducible experimental model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis).   ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Although ACE-inhibition has been shown to limit podocyte loss by enhancing survival, little is known about its effect on podocyte number following an abrupt decline in disease.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Experimental focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was induced with cytotoxic antipodocyte antibody. Following induction, groups were randomized to receive the ACE-inhibitor enalapril, the smooth muscle relaxant hydralazine (blood pressure control) or drinking water. Blood pressure, kidney function and histology were measured seven and 14 days following disease induction.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  At day 7 of disease, mean podocyte numbers were 26% and 29% lower in the enalapril and hydralazine arms, respectively, compared to normal mice in which no antibody was injected. At day 14, the mean podocyte number was only 18% lower in the enalapril arm, but was 39% lower in the hydralazine arm compared to normal mice. Podocyte proliferation did not occur at any time in any group. Compared to water- or hydralazine-treated mice with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the enalapril arm had a higher mean number of glomerular parietal epithelial cells that co-expressed the podocyte proteins WT-1 and synaptopodin, as well as phospho-ERK.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The results show following an abrupt decline in podocyte number, the initiation of ACE-inhibition but not hydralazine, was accompanied by higher podocyte number in the absence of proliferation. This was accompanied by a higher number of parietal epithelial cells that co-express podocyte proteins. Increasing podocyte number appears to be accompanied by reduced glomerulosclerosis.

TITLE:     ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES:.  Randomized controlled trials in developed countries have reported benefits of Lactobacillus GG (Lactobacillus GG) in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea, but there is paucity of such data from India. The study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus GG in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children from a semi-urban city in north India.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  In this open labelled, randomized controlled trial 200 children with acute watery diarrhoea, aged between 6 months to 5 years visiting outpatient department and emergency room of a teaching hospital in north India were enrolled. The children were randomized into receiving either Lactobacillus GG in dose of 10 billion cfu/day for five days or no probiotic medication in addition to standard WHO management of diarrhoea. Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and time to change in consistency of stools.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Also, there was faster improvement in stool consistency in children receiving Lactobacillus GG than control group [36 (30-36) h vs. 42 (36-48) h; P<0.001]. There was significant reduction in average number of stools per day in Lactobacillus GG group (P<0.001) compared to the control group. These benefits were seen irrespective of rotavirus positivity in stool tests.   ABSTRACT.INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS:.  Our results showed that the use of Lactobacillus GG in children with acute diarrhoea resulted in shorter duration and faster improvement in stool consistency as compared to the control group.

TITLE: A Web-Based Tool to Support Shared Decision Making for People With a Psychotic Disorder: Randomized Controlled Trial and Process Evaluation    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Mental health policy makers encourage the development of electronic decision aids to increase patient participation in medical decision making. Evidence is needed to determine whether these decision aids are helpful in clinical practice and whether they lead to increased patient involvement and better outcomes.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  This study reports the outcome of a randomized controlled trial and process evaluation of a Web-based intervention to facilitate shared decision making for people with psychotic disorders.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study was carried out in a Dutch mental health institution. Patients were recruited from 2 outpatient teams for patients with psychosis (N=250). Patients in the intervention condition (n=124) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aimed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization. Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own (at their home computer or at a computer of the service) or with the support of an assistant. Patients in the control group received care as usual (n=126). Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis. Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making, measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness (Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness). Process evaluation consisted of questionnaire-based surveys, open interviews, and researcher observation.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In all, 73 patients completed the follow-up measurement and were included in the final analysis (response rate 29.2%). More than one-third (48/124, 38.7%) of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid used it, and most used its full functionality. In addition, results of the process evaluation suggest that the intervention did not optimally fit in with routine practice of the participating teams.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The development of electronic decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making is encouraged and many people with a psychotic disorder can work with them. This holds for both first-episode patients and long-term care patients, although the latter group might need more assistance. However, results of this paper could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making. This may be because of weak implementation of the study protocol and a low response rate.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study was carried out in a Dutch mental health institution. Patients were recruited from 2 outpatient teams for patients with psychosis (N=250). Patients in the intervention condition (n=124) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aimed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization. Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own (at their home computer or at a computer of the service) or with the support of an assistant. Patients in the control group received care as usual (n=126). Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis. Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making, measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness (Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness). Process evaluation consisted of questionnaire-based surveys, open interviews, and researcher observation.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In all, 73 patients completed the follow-up measurement and were included in the final analysis (response rate 29.2%). More than one-third (48/124, 38.7%) of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid used it, and most used its full functionality. In addition, results of the process evaluation suggest that the intervention did not optimally fit in with routine practice of the participating teams.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The development of electronic decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making is encouraged and many people with a psychotic disorder can work with them. This holds for both first-episode patients and long-term care patients, although the latter group might need more assistance. However, results of this paper could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making. This may be because of weak implementation of the study protocol and a low response rate.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

2	5389230	Intranasal dexmedetomidine (Group D)	There was a significant difference in the incidence of Emergence agitation between Groups D and C (6.98% and 58%, respectively, with P = 0.001). TITLE: Effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia in children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Emergence agitation (Emergence agitation) after sevoflurane anesthesia is common in children during recovery from general anesthesia and may result in postoperative complications. This study investigated safety and effectiveness of intranasal dexmedetomidine in reducing the incidence and severity of Emergence agitation.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  This prospective, randomized double-blinded controlled trial included 86 patients scheduled for the tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. They were randomly allocated into two groups. Group D received intranasal dexmedetomidine at 1 μg/kg, and Group C received intranasal saline 0.9% after the induction of general anesthesia. Four-point agitation scale and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) scale for pain assessment were measured at six time points (after extubation, leaving the operating room, on arrival to postanesthesia care unit [postanesthesia care unit], 10, 20, and 30 min after arrival in postanesthesia care unit). Extubation, emergence, and discharge times were recorded in addition to any adverse effects.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The median four-point agitation scales and the median scores of Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability pain scales of Group D were significantly lower than those of Group C at the all six time points with P < 0.05. Extubation, emergence, and discharge times were comparable in both groups, and none of the subjects reported any adverse effects.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  This study demonstrates that a 1 μg/kg dose of intranasal dexmedetomidine administered after the induction of anesthesia reduces post-sevoflurane incidence and severity of Emergence agitation in children undergone tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy with no adverse effects and smooth recovery profile.

TITLE: Reduction of Nasal Bone Fracture using Ultrasound Imaging during Surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Most nasal bone fractures are corrected using non-invasive methods. Often, patients are dissatisfied with surgical outcomes following such closed approach. In this study, we compare surgical outcomes following blind closed reduction to that of ultrasound-guided reduction.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A single-institutional prospective study was performed for all nasal fracture patients (n=28) presenting between May 2013 and November 2013. Upon research consent, patients were randomly assigned to either the control group (n=14, blind reduction) or the experimental group (n=14, ultrasound-guided reduction). Surgical outcomes were evaluated using preoperative and 3-month postoperative X-ray images by two independent surgeons. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a questionnaire survey.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The experimental group consisted of 4 patients with Plane I fracture and 10 patients with Plane II fracture. The control group consisted of 3 patients with Plane I fracture and 11 patients with Plane II fracture. The mean surgical outcomes score and the mean patient dissatisfaction score were found not to differ between the experimental and the control group in Plane I fracture (p=0.755, 0.578, respectively). In a subgroup analysis consisting of Plane II fractures only, surgeons graded outcomes for ultrasound-guided reduction higher than that for the control group (p=0.007). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Our study result suggests that ultrasound-guided closed reduction is superior to blind closed reduction in those patients with Plane II nasal fractures.

TITLE: Predictors of response to prefabricated foot orthoses or rocker-sole footwear in individuals with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (1st MTPJ OA) is a common and disabling condition commonly managed with footwear and orthotic interventions. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with a successful treatment response in people with 1st MTPJ OA provided with prefabricated orthoses or rocker-sole footwear as part of a randomised clinical trial.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  People with 1st MTPJ OA (n = 88) who participated in a randomised trial were allocated to receive prefabricated foot orthoses (n = 47) or rocker-sole footwear (n = 41) and completed a baseline questionnaire including information on demographics, anthropometrics, general health, pain characteristics (including the Foot Health Status Questionnaire [Foot Health Status Questionnaire] and Foot Function Index [Foot Function Index]) and perceptions of the interventions, and a clinical assessment of foot posture, range of motion, radiographic severity and in-shoe plantar pressures. Adherence was documented using diaries. At 12 weeks, participants documented their perception of improvement on a 15-point scale. Those reporting at least moderate improvement on this scale were classified as 'responders'.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  There were 29 responders (62%) in the orthoses group and 16 responders (39%) in the rocker-sole group. In the orthoses group, responders had greater baseline pain severity while walking, a higher Foot Function Index difficulty score, and wore their orthoses more frequently. In the rocker-sole group, responders had a higher Foot Function Index stiffness score and greater radiographic severity. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The response to prefabricated orthoses or rocker-sole footwear in people with 1st MTPJ OA is related to measures of increased pain and disease severity. However, the overall classification accuracy associated with these factors is not sufficient for identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from these interventions.

Adherence was documented using diaries. At 12 weeks, participants documented their perception of improvement on a 15-point scale. Those reporting at least moderate improvement on this scale were classified as 'responders'.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  There were 29 responders (62%) in the orthoses group and 16 responders (39%) in the rocker-sole group. In the orthoses group, responders had greater baseline pain severity while walking, a higher Foot Function Index difficulty score, and wore their orthoses more frequently. In the rocker-sole group, responders had a higher Foot Function Index stiffness score and greater radiographic severity. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The response to prefabricated orthoses or rocker-sole footwear in people with 1st MTPJ OA is related to measures of increased pain and disease severity. However, the overall classification accuracy associated with these factors is not sufficient for identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from these interventions.

2	2689169	Glydescope laryngoscope	Both the Glidescope® and the AWS® performed better than the Macintosh, and demonstrate considerable promise in this context. The AWS® had the least number of dental compressions in all three scenarios, and in the cervical spine immobilization scenario it required fewer maneuvers to optimize the view of the glottis.   TITLE: Comparison of the Glidescope    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Intubation of the trachea in the pre-hospital setting may be lifesaving in severely ill and injured patients. However, tracheal intubation is frequently difficult to perform in this challenging environment, is associated with a lower success rate, and failed tracheal intubation constitutes an important cause of morbidity. Novel indirect laryngoscopes, such as the Glidescope® and the AWS® laryngoscopes may reduce this risk.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  We compared the efficacy of these devices to the Macintosh laryngoscope when used by 25 Advanced Paramedics proficient in direct laryngoscopy, in a randomized, controlled, manikin study. Following brief didactic instruction with the Glidescope® and the AWS® laryngoscopes, each participant took turns performing laryngoscopy and intubation with each device, in an easy intubation scenario and following placement of a hard cervical collar, in a SimMan® manikin.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The Glidescope® and AWS® devices possess advantages over the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope when used by Advanced Paramedics in normal and simulated difficult intubation scenarios in this manikin study. Further studies are required to extend these findings to the clinical setting.

2	4892327	Ischemia group	The number of active caspase-3-positive neurons in CA1 area were significantly increased in ischemia group, compared to sham-operated group (P<0.001), and exercise preconditioning significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase-3 activation, compared to the ischemia group (P<0.05). TITLE: Protection of Hippocampal CA1 Neurons Against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Exercise Preconditioning via Modulation of Bax/Bcl-2 Ratio and Prevention of Caspase-3 Activation    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.  Ischemia leads to loss of neurons by apoptosis in specific brain regions, especially in the hippocampus. The purpose of this study was investigating the effects of exercise preconditioning on expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 proteins in hippocampal CA1 neurons after induction of cerebral ischemia.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Male rats weighing 260–300 g were randomly allocated into three groups (sham, exercise, and ischemia). The rats in exercise group were trained to run on a treadmill 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Ischemia was induced by the occlusion of both common carotid arteries (common carotid arteries) for 20 min. Levels of expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 proteins in CA1 area of hippocampus were determined by immunohistochemical staining .   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Also, results indicated a significant increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in ischemia group, compared to sham-operated group (P<0.001).   ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION:.  This study indicated that exercise has a neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia when used as preconditioning stimuli.

2	3742017	E-group - The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program) provides a system of NICU care and environmental structure that supports preterm infants' early brain development.	E-performed significantly better than C-group children on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition) and trended towards better scores on the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. TITLE: School Age Effects of the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program for Medically Low-Risk Preterm Infants: Preliminary Findings    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  By school-age, even low-risk moderately preterm-born children show more neuro-cognitive deficits, motor impairments, academic underachievement, behavioral problems, and poor social adaptation than full-term peers.   ABSTRACT.AIM:.  To evaluate the outcomes at school-age for moderately preterm-born children (29-33 weeks gestational age), appropriate in growth for gestational age (appropriate in growth for gestational age) and medically at low-risk, randomized to Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program) or standard care in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit. At school-age, the experimental (experimental) group will show better neuropsychological and neuro-electrophysiological function, as well as improved brain structure than the control (control) group.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  The original sample consisted of 30 moderately preterm-born infants (29 to 33 weeks), 23 (8C and 15E) of them were evaluated at 8 years of age, corrected-for-prematurity with neuropsychological, EEG spectral coherence, and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) measures.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  They also showed more mature frontal and parietal brain connectivities, and more mature fiber tracts involving the internal capsule and the cingulum. Neurobehavioral results in the newborn period successfully predicted neuropsychological functioning at 8 years corrected age.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Moderately preterm infants cared for with the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program intervention showed improved neuropsychological and neuro-electrophysiological function as well as improved brain structure at school-age.

2	5928132	L-DOPA and rivastigmine	Results: As predicted, L-DOPA and rivastigmine resulted in enhanced PAS-induced Long-term potentiation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dextromethorphan inhibited it compared to placebo. TITLE: Pharmacological Modulation of Long-Term Potentiation-Like Activity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex    ABSTRACT.  Background: Long-term potentiation (Long-term potentiation) depends on glutamatergic neurotransmission and is modulated by cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic inputs. Paired associative stimulation (Paired associative stimulation) is a neurostimulation paradigm that, when combined with electroencephalography (electroencephalography), assesses LTP-like activity (PAS-induced Long-term potentiation) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Thus, we conducted a study to assess the role of cholinergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission on PAS-induced Long-term potentiation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We hypothesized that increasing the dopaminergic tone with L-DOPA and the cholinergic tone with rivastigmine will enhance PAS-induced Long-term potentiation, while increasing the GABAergic tone with baclofen and inhibiting glutamatergic neurotransmission with dextromethorphan will reduce it compared to placebo.   Methods: In this randomized controlled, double-blind cross-over within-subject study, 12 healthy participants received five sessions of Paired associative stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a random order, each preceded by the administration of placebo or one of the four active drugs. PAS-induced Long-term potentiation was assessed after each drug administration and compared to PAS-induced Long-term potentiation after placebo.   In contrast, baclofen did not significantly suppress PAS-induced Long-term potentiation compared to placebo.   Conclusions: This study provides a novel approach to study dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neuroplasticity and its modulation in patients with brain disorders that are associated with abnormalities in these neurochemical systems. This study was based on a single dose administration of each drug. Given that these drugs are typically administered chronically, future studies should assess the effects of chronic administration.

Methods: In this randomized controlled, double-blind cross-over within-subject study, 12 healthy participants received five sessions of Paired associative stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a random order, each preceded by the administration of placebo or one of the four active drugs. PAS-induced Long-term potentiation was assessed after each drug administration and compared to PAS-induced Long-term potentiation after placebo.   In contrast, baclofen did not significantly suppress PAS-induced Long-term potentiation compared to placebo.   Conclusions: This study provides a novel approach to study dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neuroplasticity and its modulation in patients with brain disorders that are associated with abnormalities in these neurochemical systems. This study was based on a single dose administration of each drug. Given that these drugs are typically administered chronically, future studies should assess the effects of chronic administration.

TITLE: Pharmacological Modulation of Long-Term Potentiation-Like Activity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex    ABSTRACT.  Background: Long-term potentiation (Long-term potentiation) depends on glutamatergic neurotransmission and is modulated by cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic inputs. Paired associative stimulation (Paired associative stimulation) is a neurostimulation paradigm that, when combined with electroencephalography (electroencephalography), assesses LTP-like activity (PAS-induced Long-term potentiation) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Thus, we conducted a study to assess the role of cholinergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission on PAS-induced Long-term potentiation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

TITLE: A randomized, controlled trial of interferon-β-1a (Avonex    ABSTRACT.  The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and possible efficacy of IFN-β-1a for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis). Twenty-two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were enrolled in a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 30 μg IFN-β-1a by weekly self-injection for 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was safety. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (American College of Rheumatology) 20 response at 24 weeks. There were no significant differences in adverse events reported in the two groups. Sixty-nine percent of patients receiving IFN-β and 67% receiving placebo terminated the study early, most of them secondary to a perceived lack of efficacy. Overall, IFN-β-1a had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20 response between the two groups.

TITLE: Efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase inhibitor peficitinib (ASP015K) monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in Japan: a 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To evaluate the efficacy, safety and dose response of a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor, peficitinib (ASP015K), as monotherapy in Japanese patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In a 12-week, double-blind study, 281 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis with active disease not on concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy were randomised equally to once-daily placebo or peficitinib 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg. The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (American College of Rheumatology) 20 response in the peficitinib treatment groups versus placebo at week 12.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Mean age was 53.0 years, 81.1% were female and 25.3% had previously used antitumour necrosis factor therapy. The total incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (treatment-emergent adverse events) was similar between the placebo (64.3%) and peficitinib 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg groups (70.9%, 64.9%, 52.7% and 67.2%, respectively). treatment-emergent adverse events occurring more frequently in the peficitinib group compared with the placebo group included nasopharyngitis, increased blood creatine phosphokinase and diarrhoea. No cases of serious infections were reported. Herpes zoster occurred in four patients (two each in peficitinib 25 and 100 mg).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Treatment with peficitinib as monotherapy for 12 weeks in Japanese patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis is efficacious and showed acceptable safety profile. These findings support further developments of peficitinib for rheumatoid arthritis treatment.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.  NCT01649999; Results.

The primary endpoint was American College of Rheumatology (American College of Rheumatology) 20 response in the peficitinib treatment groups versus placebo at week 12.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Mean age was 53.0 years, 81.1% were female and 25.3% had previously used antitumour necrosis factor therapy. Peficitinib 50, 100 and 150 mg each showed statistically significantly higher ACR20 response rates compared with placebo, and response rates increased up to 150 mg with a statistically significant dose response. treatment-emergent adverse events occurring more frequently in the peficitinib group compared with the placebo group included nasopharyngitis, increased blood creatine phosphokinase and diarrhoea. No cases of serious infections were reported. Herpes zoster occurred in four patients (two each in peficitinib 25 and 100 mg).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Treatment with peficitinib as monotherapy for 12 weeks in Japanese patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis is efficacious and showed acceptable safety profile. These findings support further developments of peficitinib for rheumatoid arthritis treatment.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.  NCT01649999; Results.

TITLE: Comparison of pregnancy outcome in half-dose Triptorelin and short-acting Decapeptyl in long protocol in assisted reproductive technology cycles: A randomized clinical trial    ABSTRACT.   Background: Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) agonist is used for controlling ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technology (assisted reproductive technology) cycles which has some benefits.    Objective: To compare the efficacy of two different formulations of Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist: short-acting and long-acting, for assisted reproductive technology protocols.    Materials and Methods: In a prospective randomized study, one hundred women who underwent assisted reproductive technology cycles were randomly divided into two groups. In group I, the patients received one single injection of 1.87 mg Triptorelin in previous mid-luteal phase. In group II, Decapeptyl 0.1 mg per day started from previous mid-luteal phase. Pregnancy outcome in in vitro fertilization (in vitro fertilization) cycle was compared between two groups.    Conclusion: There were not any advantages in in vitro fertilization outcome between half-dose long-acting and short-acting Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist groups in assisted reproductive technology cycle.

2	5791393	With catheter (group II)	Intensity of pain measured by the Visual Analog Scale was higher in Group II. TITLE: The impact of urinary bladder catheterisation after ureterorenoscopic stone removal on the postoperative course    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  The most frequent reason for ureterorenoscopy is the necessity to remove calculi from the ureter and/or kidney. After completing this procedure the Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder. The aim of the study is to show whether catheterisation of the bladder after ureterorenoscopic stone removal in patients with a low-risk of complications is necessary and indicated.   ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS.  This is a comparative, prospective and randomized study. 100 patients meeting the assumed criteria, subjected to the ureterorenoscopy due to ureter and/or kidney stones participated in the study. The patients were divided into the experimental (Group I) and control (Group II) groups. Group I did not have a catheter, Group II was catheterised. There were two subgroups: female and male in each group. Mean values of the following parameters were calculated: intensity of postoperative pain measured by Visual Analog Pain Scale, the number of additional doses of painkillers administered after the procedure, hospital stay, occurrence of fever, significant bacteriuria, acute urinary retention and post- void retention greater than 30 ml.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Catheterisation does not influence: the number of additional doses of ketoprofen and pethidine administered during the 1st day after the operation, the duration of hospitalization, the occurrence of fever, significant bacteriuria, the postoperative acute urinary retention and the post-void residual urine volume.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  In patients with a low risk of postoperative complications who did not have any intraoperative complications, catheterisation of the urinary bladder increases discomfort without bringing any benefits.

2	5504600	perioperative oral extended-release tapentadol	Safety: Vomiting on day 1 occurred in 11%, constipation in 35% of the tapentadol patients and in 16% and 30% of the oxycodone/naloxone patients (p = 0.60 and 0.33), respectively. TITLE: Combatting pain after orthopedic/trauma surgery- perioperative oral extended-release tapentadol vs. extended-release oxycodone/naloxone    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  High post-operative pain scores after "minor" orthopedic/trauma surgery are in part attributed to inadequate prescription of opioid analgesics. Novel concepts aiming to achieve sufficient analgesia while minimizing opioid-related side effects by avoiding fluctuating plasma levels are based on perioperative oral administration of extended-release opioids beginning with the first dose pre-operatively. This is the first study to evaluate analgesic efficacy and side effect rates of extended-release tapentadol compared to oxycodone/naloxone following orthopedic/trauma surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled prospective clinical trial had 2 co-primary endpoints: (1) Analgesic efficacy: Mean pain level on a numeric rating scale (numeric rating scale) from 0 to 10 during exercise over 5 days. (2) Safety: Side effect sum score of the following events: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, vertigo, somnolence. The study was powered to detect superiority of tapentadol for at least one endpoint pending statistical proof of non-inferiority for both endpoints in a first step.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Two hundred sixty-six trauma patients were randomized to receive either tapentadol (n = 133) or oxycodone/naloxone (n = 133). Analgesic efficacy: Mean (±SD) daily pain levels in the first five post-operative days were 2.8 ± 1.3 in both groups. Mean maximum pain intensity during exercise in the first 24 h after surgery was 3.8 ± 1.9 (tapentadol) and 3.8 ± 2.1 (oxycodone/naloxone). Statistically tapentadol was non-inferior but not superior to oxycodone/naloxone. The incidence of sedation/ vertigo was <10%, that of somnolence <2% in both groups (p > 0.3, respectively). The sum score of side effect events was 51% in the tapentadol vs. 49% in the oxycodone/naloxone group; risk difference 3% [95% CI, −8 to 14%]; p = 0.6). Non-inferiority of tapentadol could not be concluded as the pre-defined non-inferiority margin was exceeded.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  With both concepts, mean maximum pain intensity during exercise within the first 24 h after orthopedic/trauma surgery was reduced to a score of <4. This analgesic efficacy came at the cost of mainly gastro-intestinal side effects. Thus, we now use a prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting and pre-emptive laxatives as part of these concepts.

This is the first study to evaluate analgesic efficacy and side effect rates of extended-release tapentadol compared to oxycodone/naloxone following orthopedic/trauma surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled prospective clinical trial had 2 co-primary endpoints: (1) Analgesic efficacy: Mean pain level on a numeric rating scale (numeric rating scale) from 0 to 10 during exercise over 5 days. (2) Safety: Side effect sum score of the following events: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, vertigo, somnolence. The study was powered to detect superiority of tapentadol for at least one endpoint pending statistical proof of non-inferiority for both endpoints in a first step.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Two hundred sixty-six trauma patients were randomized to receive either tapentadol (n = 133) or oxycodone/naloxone (n = 133). Analgesic efficacy: Mean (±SD) daily pain levels in the first five post-operative days were 2.8 ± 1.3 in both groups. Mean maximum pain intensity during exercise in the first 24 h after surgery was 3.8 ± 1.9 (tapentadol) and 3.8 ± 2.1 (oxycodone/naloxone). Statistically tapentadol was non-inferior but not superior to oxycodone/naloxone. The incidence of sedation/ vertigo was <10%, that of somnolence <2% in both groups (p > 0.3, respectively). The sum score of side effect events was 51% in the tapentadol vs. 49% in the oxycodone/naloxone group; risk difference 3% [95% CI, −8 to 14%]; p = 0.6). Non-inferiority of tapentadol could not be concluded as the pre-defined non-inferiority margin was exceeded.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  With both concepts, mean maximum pain intensity during exercise within the first 24 h after orthopedic/trauma surgery was reduced to a score of <4. This analgesic efficacy came at the cost of mainly gastro-intestinal side effects. Thus, we now use a prophylaxis against nausea and vomiting and pre-emptive laxatives as part of these concepts.

2	5536558	Caudal block	No significant differences were observed in the percentage inhibition of the maximal resting pressure among the three regional anaesthetic groups. TITLE: Comparison of saddle, lumbar epidural and caudal blocks on anal sphincter tone: A prospective, randomized study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To compare the effects of saddle, lumbar epidural and caudal blocks on anal sphincter tone using anorectal manometry.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients undergoing elective anorectal surgery with regional anaesthesia were divided randomly into three groups and received a saddle (saddle), lumbar epidural (lumbar epidural), or caudal (caudal) block. Anorectal manometry was performed before and 30 min after each regional block. The degree of motor blockade of the anal sphincter was compared using the maximal resting pressure (maximal resting pressure) and the maximal squeezing pressure (maximal squeezing pressure).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The study analysis population consisted of 49 patients (saddle group, n = 18; lumbar epidural group, n = 16; caudal group, n = 15). However, percentage inhibition of the maximal squeezing pressure was significantly greater in the saddle group (83.6 ± 13.7%) compared with the lumbar epidural group (58.4 ± 19.8%) and the caudal group (47.8 ± 16.9%). In all groups, maximal squeezing pressure was reduced significantly more than maximal resting pressure after each regional block.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Saddle block was more effective than lumbar epidural or caudal block for depressing anal sphincter tone. No differences were detected between lumbar epidural and caudal blocks.

Patients undergoing elective anorectal surgery with regional anaesthesia were divided randomly into three groups and received a saddle (saddle), lumbar epidural (lumbar epidural), or caudal (caudal) block. Anorectal manometry was performed before and 30 min after each regional block. The degree of motor blockade of the anal sphincter was compared using the maximal resting pressure (maximal resting pressure) and the maximal squeezing pressure (maximal squeezing pressure).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The study analysis population consisted of 49 patients (saddle group, n = 18; lumbar epidural group, n = 16; caudal group, n = 15). No significant differences were observed in the percentage inhibition of the maximal resting pressure among the three regional anaesthetic groups. In all groups, maximal squeezing pressure was reduced significantly more than maximal resting pressure after each regional block.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Saddle block was more effective than lumbar epidural or caudal block for depressing anal sphincter tone. No differences were detected between lumbar epidural and caudal blocks.

TITLE: A post hoc analysis of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant (vitamin K antagonist) therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (recurrent VTE) in patients with cancer and renal impairment    ABSTRACT.  Venous thromboembolism (Venous thromboembolism) is a common and serious complication in patients with cancer; treatment guidelines recommend extended therapy of ≥6 months with low-molecular-weight heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin) for treatment and prevention of recurrent Venous thromboembolism (recurrent VTE) in this population. This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study—a phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled study (N = 676)—to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, versus vitamin K antagonist (vitamin K antagonist) for prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min). Overall, 162/676 (24 %) patients had renal impairment at baseline. Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU/kg once daily during month 1, followed by 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; or vitamin K antagonist once daily for 6 months, with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200 IU/kg once daily for ≥5 days until international normalized ratio was 2.0–3.0 for 2 consecutive days. Endpoints included the rates of recurrent VTE (primary) and bleeding events. Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar (p = 0.47). In summary, compared with vitamin K antagonist, dalteparin significantly reduced risk of recurrent VTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (p = 0.01) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function; however, anti-Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients, particularly those with very severe renal impairment.

TITLE: Salmeterol/fluticasone stable-dose treatment compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing: impact on health-related quality of life    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Improving patients' health-related quality of life (health-related quality of life) is recognized as a fundamental part of asthma management. The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term efficacy (including symptom-free days and exacerbations) and impact on health-related quality of life of a stable-dose regimen of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate) and an adjustable maintenance dosing (adjustable maintenance dosing) regimen of formoterol/budesonide (formoterol/budesonide) where treatment is adjusted based on symptoms [SAM40056].   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A total of 688 outpatients with asthma receiving regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids) plus a long-acting β2-agonist, or medium dose inhaled corticosteroids alone participated in this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, 1-year trial, which was conducted in 91 centers in 15 countries. Patients were randomized to receive 1 inhalation of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 μg BID or 2 inhalations of formoterol/budesonide 6/200 μg BID during Weeks 1–4. For Weeks 5–52, patients meeting strict continuation criteria for stable asthma at Week 4 received adjustable maintenance dosing with formoterol/budesonide or stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The percentage of symptom-free days was significantly greater (58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034) and the annual exacerbation rate was significantly lower (47%; p = 0.008) with stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing. A total of 568 patients completed the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) at least once during the study. However, in a post hoc logistic regression analyses for any Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire improvement, significant benefits with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate were seen at both time points (p = 0.038 and p = 0.009, respectively). The minimally important difference of ≥ 0.5-point improvement in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire overall score was achieved by a significantly greater number of patients receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate at Week 28 (68% vs 60%; p = 0.049); a trend for this difference remained at Week 52 (71% vs 65%) (p = 0.205).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In this population of patients with persistent asthma, stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater increases in symptom-free days, a reduction in exacerbation rates, and provided greater health-related quality of life benefits compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing.

The minimally important difference of ≥ 0.5-point improvement in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire overall score was achieved by a significantly greater number of patients receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate at Week 28 (68% vs 60%; p = 0.049); a trend for this difference remained at Week 52 (71% vs 65%) (p = 0.205).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In this population of patients with persistent asthma, stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater increases in symptom-free days, a reduction in exacerbation rates, and provided greater health-related quality of life benefits compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing.

TITLE: Salmeterol/fluticasone stable-dose treatment compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing: impact on health-related quality of life    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Improving patients' health-related quality of life (health-related quality of life) is recognized as a fundamental part of asthma management. The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term efficacy (including symptom-free days and exacerbations) and impact on health-related quality of life of a stable-dose regimen of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate) and an adjustable maintenance dosing (adjustable maintenance dosing) regimen of formoterol/budesonide (formoterol/budesonide) where treatment is adjusted based on symptoms [SAM40056].   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A total of 688 outpatients with asthma receiving regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids) plus a long-acting β2-agonist, or medium dose inhaled corticosteroids alone participated in this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, 1-year trial, which was conducted in 91 centers in 15 countries. Patients were randomized to receive 1 inhalation of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 μg BID or 2 inhalations of formoterol/budesonide 6/200 μg BID during Weeks 1–4. For Weeks 5–52, patients meeting strict continuation criteria for stable asthma at Week 4 received adjustable maintenance dosing with formoterol/budesonide or stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The percentage of symptom-free days was significantly greater (58.8% vs 52.1%; p = 0.034) and the annual exacerbation rate was significantly lower (47%; p = 0.008) with stable-dose salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with formoterol/budesonide adjustable maintenance dosing. A total of 568 patients completed the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) at least once during the study. The mean change from baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire overall score was numerically greater with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate than formoterol/budesonide at week 28 and week 52, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.121 at Week 52).

2	3831918	pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 70 mmHg	Cuff inflation resulted in stepwise increases in retrograde shear rate (P < 0.05 for main effect). TITLE: Manipulation of arterial stiffness, wave reflections, and retrograde shear rate in the femoral artery using lower limb external compression    ABSTRACT.  Exposure of the arterial wall to retrograde shear acutely leads to endothelial dysfunction and chronically contributes to a proatherogenic vascular phenotype. Arterial stiffness and increased pressure from wave reflections are known arbiters of blood flow in the systemic circulation and each related to atherosclerosis. Using distal external compression of the calf to increase upstream retrograde shear in the superficial femoral artery (superficial femoral artery), we examined the hypothesis that changes in retrograde shear are correlated with changes in superficial femoral artery stiffness and pressure from wave reflections. For this purpose, a pneumatic cuff was applied to the calf and inflated to 0, 35, and 70 mmHg (5 min compression, randomized order, separated by 5 min) in 16 healthy young men (23 ± 1 years of age). Doppler ultrasound and wave intensity analysis was used to measure superficial femoral artery retrograde shear rate, reflected pressure wave intensity (negative area [negative area]), elastic modulus (Ep), and a single-point pulse wave velocity (pulse wave velocity) during acute cuff inflation. There were also significant cuff pressure-dependent increases in negative area, Ep, and pulse wave velocity across conditions (P < 0.05 for main effects). Change in negative area, but not Ep or pulse wave velocity, was associated with change in retrograde shear rate across conditions (P < 0.05). In conclusion, external compression of the calf increases retrograde shear, arterial stiffness, and pressure from wave reflection in the upstream superficial femoral artery in a dose-dependent manner. Wave reflection intensity, but not arterial stiffness, is correlated with changes in peripheral retrograde shear with this hemodynamic manipulation.

TITLE: Efficacy of Blood Pressure reduction of Losartan in selected Thai populations using Home Blood Pressure Monitoring and Office Blood Pressure measurements    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Angiotensin Receptor Blockades (Angiotensin Receptor Blockades) is becoming a first line drug for essential Hypertension for many types of patient. Losartan is the prototype of Angiotensin Receptor Blockades due to its vast clinical trials. Home Blood pressure monitoring can provide accurate evaluation of certain drug effect on blood pressure with small number of patient samples. Local production of medicine has made the Medicine readily available and could bring about clinical improvement. Our hypothesis was that Thai population with essential hypertension responded quite well to Losartan and Generic Losartan was not inferior to Original- Losartan.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  To evaluate the effectiveness and safety in BP reduction by Losartan in certain Thai population and to compare these parameters between Generic Losartan and Original-Losartan using both office and HBPM method.   ABSTRACT.METHOD:.  After a two-week run-in period when they would learn to use HBPM device and their blood pressure were still recorded to be higher than 140/90 by office BP or 135/85 by HBPM with or without previous medical regimen, 24 patients were randomized to receive either Generic Losartan or Original-Losartan for 6 weeks. Then they would cross over to receive the alternative and were followed again at 6 weeks. HBPM was performed in the morning and in the evening for 5 days, at baseline, and after 6 & 12 weeks. Office BP measurements were obtained at baseline and after 6 & 12 weeks.   ABSTRACT.RESULT:.  One patient in each group dropped out from the study. 22 patients with average age of 54 and averaged office BP 154/88 completed the 12 weeks study. By office BP, SBP was reduced by 27±14.2 at week 6 and 28±15.1 mmHg at week 12. At the end of 12 weeks 68% (15/22) of patients had Office BP <140/90 and 64% (14/22) of patients had HBPM <135/85. There was no significant difference of BP reduction at week 6 between Original-xLosartan and Generic Losartan group. After crossover the BP reduction was maintained in both groups. The percentage of patient whose Office BP <140/90 or HBPM <135/85 were not different among the two Losartan groups. There was no serious adverse side effect.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Using both office BP and HBPM this group of Thai patient with essential hypertension responded well to Losartan and Generic Losartan.

TITLE: Cholecalciferol Additively Reduces Serum Parathyroid Hormone Levels in Severe Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Treated with Calcitriol and Cinacalcet among Hemodialysis Patients    ABSTRACT.  We evaluated the improvement of intact parathyroid hormone (intact parathyroid hormone) levels and bone parameters by supplementing nutritional vitamin D (cholecalciferol) to combined calcimimetic (cinacalcet) and active vitamin D analog (calcitriol) among severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (secondary hyperparathyroidism) hemodialysis (hemodialysis) patients. A randomized, controlled open-label study was undertaken in 60 hemodialysis patients with serum intact parathyroid hormone > 1000 pg/mL or persistently high intact parathyroid hormone ≥ 600 pg/mL even after >3 months of calcitriol (3 μg/week). The study group received oral cholecalciferol (5000 IU/ day) and the control group received a placebo. All patients received fixed dose cinacalcet (30 mg/day, orally) and calcitriol. Calcitriol was reduced if intact parathyroid hormone ≤ 300 pg/mL and cinacalcet was withdrawn if serum intact parathyroid hormone was persistently low (intact parathyroid hormone ≤ 300 pg/mL) for 4 weeks after the reduction of calcitriol. Most patients achieved serum 25-(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/mL in the study group. Nearly 40% of study patients gained >10% improvement in femoral neck (femoral neck) bone mineral density (bone mineral density). We conclude that cholecalciferol additively reduced serum intact parathyroid hormone levels, improved 25-(OH)D3 levels and improved femoral neck bone mineral density when used together with cinacalcet/calcitriol in severe secondary hyperparathyroidism hemodialysis patients.

In addition, changes in mean scores of lifestyle scale (42.4 ± 13.6), quality of life scale (29.1 ± 14.2), self-efficacy (16.1 ± 2.6), perceived affect (16.1 ± 8), social support (35.4 ± 12.4), and barriers (17.2 ± 15.8) before and after intervention were significant in the intervention group 2 (P < 0.0001).   TITLE: Effects of Educational Intervention on Health-Promoting Lifestyle and Health-Related Life quality of Methamphetamine Users and Their Families: a Randomized Clinical Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Family-centered empowerment of drug and stimulant users is an effective program for a better response to treatment, prevention of treatment adverse effects, and promotion quality of life (quality of life) and lifestyle in the process of discontinuing drug abuse.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:.  This study aimed to determine the effects of educational intervention, based on family-centered empowerment and Pender's health promotion models, on health-promoting lifestyle and health-related quality of life among methamphetamine users and their families.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS:.  In a randomized clinical trial, methamphetamine users, who were admitted to Tehran University of Medical Sciences Substance Abuse Treatment Centers, were randomly allocated to three groups: a group for training of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 1;95 subjects);a group for training of a family member of methamphetamine users who were in recovery phase (intervention group 2; 95 subjects); and a control group (95 subjects). A demographic checklist and a standard questionnaire covering health-promoting lifestyle, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, perceived affect, perceived social support, and perceived barriers dimensions were used to gather required data. Independent-samples t test, paired-samples t-test, and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Application of family-centered empowerment model among methamphetamine users and their families is practically feasible and can result in enhancement and improvement of their quality of life, lifestyle, and health promotion model constructs.

2	4171887	Radioiodine fixed dose	There is no statistically significant difference between the success rates of the two methods at 3 months. TITLE: Comparison of clinical outcome after a fixed dose versus dosimetry-based radioiodine treatment of Graves’ disease: Results of a randomized controlled trial in Indian population    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  Two approaches are used to treat Graves' disease with radioiodine (131I)–the fixed dose approach and the other based on dosimetry. A prospective study was performed to compare the results of these two approaches in a randomized patient population, as such study is lacking in the Indian population till date.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Patients with Graves' disease were randomized into two groups: (1) Fixed dose group and the (2) Calculated dose group, each comprising of 20 patients. All the patients underwent detailed clinical and biochemical evaluation. Thyroid mass was determined by high resolution ultrasound machine with linear transducer of 7-11 MHz. Patients were given 185-370 kBq (5-10 uCi) of 131I and 24 hr radioiodine uptake (radioiodine uptake) was calculated using thyroid uptake probe and thyroid phantom. Fixed dose group patients were administered 185MBq of 131I. Calculated dose group patients were given 131I as per the following formula: Calculated dose = [3700 kBq/g × estimated thyroid wt. (g)] ÷ 24 hr radioiodine uptake (%). Success of first dose of radioiodine was defined as clinically/biochemically euthyroid/hypothyroid status at the end of 3 months without the need for further therapy.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  In the fixed dose group, eight patients were hyperthyroid, four were euthyroid, and eight were hypothyroid after the first dose at 3 months. Success rate of first dose was 60%. In calculated dose group, seven patients were hyperthyroid, eight were euthyroid, and five were hypothyroid. Success rate of first dose was 65%.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Hence, fixed dose approach may be used for treatment of Graves' disease as it is simple and convenient for the patient. Longer follow-up with higher number of patients should be done to confirm or contradict our findings.

TITLE: Effects of purified anthocyanin supplementation on platelet chemokines in hypocholesterolemic individuals: a randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  It is becoming increasingly evident that platelet chemokines are involved in distinct aspects of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of long-term supplementation with purified anthocyanins on platelet chemokines in hypercholesterolemic individuals and to identify correlations of decreased platelet chemokine levels with serum lipid and inflammatory marker levels.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A total of 146 hypercholesterolemic individuals were recruited and treated with 320 mg of purified anthocyanins (n = 73) or a placebo (n = 73) daily for 24 weeks in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks significantly decreased the plasma CXCL7 (–12.32% vs. 4.22%, P = 0.001), CXCL5 (–9.95% vs. 1.93%, P = 0.011), CXCL8 (–6.07% vs. 0.66%, P = 0.004), CXCL12 (–8.11% vs. 5.43%, P = 0.023) and CCL2 levels (–11.63% vs. 12.84%, P = 0.001) compared with the placebo. Interestingly, the decreases in the CXCL7 and CCL2 levels were both positively correlated with the decreases in the serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and interleukin-1β (interleukin-1β) levels after anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks. The decrease in the CXCL8 level was negatively correlated with the increase in the how-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (how-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) level and was positively correlated with the decrease in the soluble P-selectin (soluble P-selectin) level in the anthocyanin group. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between the decreases in the CXCL12 and tumornecrosis factor-α (tumornecrosis factor-α) levels after anthocyanin supplementation. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The present study supports the notion that platelet chemokines are promising targets of anthocyanins in the prevention of atherosclerosis.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

Anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks significantly decreased the plasma CXCL7 (–12.32% vs. 4.22%, P = 0.001), CXCL5 (–9.95% vs. 1.93%, P = 0.011), CXCL8 (–6.07% vs. 0.66%, P = 0.004), CXCL12 (–8.11% vs. 5.43%, P = 0.023) and CCL2 levels (–11.63% vs. 12.84%, P = 0.001) compared with the placebo. Interestingly, the decreases in the CXCL7 and CCL2 levels were both positively correlated with the decreases in the serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and interleukin-1β (interleukin-1β) levels after anthocyanin supplementation for 24 weeks. The decrease in the CXCL8 level was negatively correlated with the increase in the how-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (how-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) level and was positively correlated with the decrease in the soluble P-selectin (soluble P-selectin) level in the anthocyanin group. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between the decreases in the CXCL12 and tumornecrosis factor-α (tumornecrosis factor-α) levels after anthocyanin supplementation. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The present study supports the notion that platelet chemokines are promising targets of anthocyanins in the prevention of atherosclerosis.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

In group I, pain was reduced significantly after treatment with verum compared to placebo at both time points. In group II, the individual pain rating shift showed statistically significant lower pain after treatment. TITLE: Efficacy and Safety of a Lidocaine Gel in Patients from 6 Months up to 8 Years with Acute Painful Sites in the Oral Cavity: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Comparative Study    ABSTRACT.  Lidocaine is a well-accepted topical anaesthetic, also used in minors to treat painful conditions on mucosal membranes. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (registered prospectively as EudraCT number 2011-005336-25) was designed to generate efficacy and safety data for a lidocaine gel (2%) in younger children with painful conditions in the oral cavity. One hundred sixty-one children were included in two subgroups: 4–8 years, average age 6.4 years, treated with verum or placebo and 6 months–<4 years, average age 1.8 years, treated only with verum. Pain reduction was measured from the time prior to administration to 10 or 30 minutes after. Only seven out of 161 patients reported an adverse event but none were classified as being related to the study medication. The local tolerability was assessed as very good in over 97% of cases. For painful sites in the oral cavity, a 2% lidocaine gel is a meaningful tool for short-term treatment in the paediatric population.

2	5702778	High-level carbonated water with calcium ions	The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except Group 3 (low-level carbonated water with calcium ions) were significantly greater than those in the Control group. TITLE: Effect of carbonated water manufactured by a soda carbonator on etched or sealed enamel    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of carbonated water on etched or sealed enamel according to the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Carbonated water with different carbonation levels was manufactured by a soda carbonator. Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen preparation of the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups, all the specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups were performed with 10 specimens from each group. Scanning electron microscopy (Scanning electron microscopy) tests on the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups were performed with 5 specimens from each group. Microhardness changes in different groups were statistically compared using paired t-tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The microhardness changes were significantly different between the groups (p = 0.000). Scanning electron microscopy showed that etched areas of the specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction varied between groups. Adhesive material was partially removed in groups exposed to carbonated water.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Carbonated water has negative effects on etched or sealed enamel, resulting in decreased microhardness and removal of the adhesive material.

2	3268925	breast conserving surgery (breast conserving surgery)	Locoregional disease-free survival did not statistically differ between the two operation methods for the patients who were planned for a mastectomy at the initial exam.   TITLE: Locoregional Recurrence of Breast Conserving Surgery after Preoperative Chemotherapy in Korean Women with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  Preoperative chemotherapy has been used to increase the rate of breast conserving surgery (breast conserving surgery) in Caucasian women. However, whether it would also increase the rate of breast conserving surgery in Korean women has not been verified. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of preoperative chemotherapy to make breast conserving surgery possible in Korean women who have locally advanced cancer without any increase of locoregional recurrence according to operation methods (breast conserving surgery vs. mastectomy).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  From August 2002 to April 2005, 205 patients with stage II or III breast cancer were enrolled in a phase III randomized trial of preoperative chemotherapy. Surgeons decided on the type of surgery (mastectomy or breast conserving surgery) at initial diagnosis. By randomization, patients received four cycles of either docetaxel/capecitabine or doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by surgery and crossover to the other treatment as postoperative chemotherapy.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The mean tumor size was 3.29 cm and the mean breast volume was 489 cc at diagnosis. After preoperative chemotherapy, clinical response was shown in 76.0% of the patients. Of the 71 patients planned for a mastectomy at initial diagnosis, 27 patients underwent breast conserving surgery (38.0%). Clinical T stage after preoperative chemotherapy, pathologic T size and lymphatic invasion were correlated with conversion to breast conserving surgery. In multivariate analysis, only lymphatic invasion showed statistical significance. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study showed that preoperative chemotherapy also increased the rate of breast conserving surgery, while avoiding any increase of locoregional recurrence in Korean women with locally advanced breast cancer.

TITLE: Safety, tolerability, clinical, and joint structural outcomes of a single intra-articular injection of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells in patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a controlled double-blind randomised trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Few clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for the management of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and tolerability and to explore the efficacy of a single intra-articular injection of allogeneic human mesenchymal precursor cells (mesenchymal precursor cells) to improve clinical symptoms and retard joint structural deterioration over 24 months in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this phase Ib/IIa, double-blind, active comparator clinical study, 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomized (2:1) to receive either a single intra-articular injection of 75 million allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells suspended in hyaluronan (hyaluronan) (MPC + hyaluronan group) (n = 11) or hyaluronan alone (n = 6). Patients were monitored for adverse events. Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-HLA panel reactive antibodies (panel reactive antibodies) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry. Pain, function, and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2 scores. Joint space width was measured from radiographs, and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + hyaluronan group and 0 out of 6 hyaluronan controls. No cell-related serious adverse effects were observed. Increases in class I panel reactive antibodies >10% were observed at week 4 in the MPC + hyaluronan group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104. Compared with the hyaluronan group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (p < 0.05). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Intra-articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was safe, well tolerated, and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes. These findings suggest that mesenchymal precursor cells warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

In this phase Ib/IIa, double-blind, active comparator clinical study, 17 patients aged 18–40 years with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were randomized (2:1) to receive either a single intra-articular injection of 75 million allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells suspended in hyaluronan (hyaluronan) (MPC + hyaluronan group) (n = 11) or hyaluronan alone (n = 6). Patients were monitored for adverse events. Immunogenicity was evaluated by anti-HLA panel reactive antibodies (panel reactive antibodies) against class I and II HLAs determined by flow cytometry. Pain, function, and quality of life were assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2 scores. Joint space width was measured from radiographs, and tibial cartilage volume and bone area assessed from magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Moderate arthralgia and swelling within 24 h following injection that subsided were observed in 4 out of 11 in the MPC + hyaluronan group and 0 out of 6 hyaluronan controls. Increases in class I panel reactive antibodies >10% were observed at week 4 in the MPC + hyaluronan group that decreased to baseline levels by week 104. Compared with the hyaluronan group, MPC + HA-treated patients showed greater improvements in KOOS pain, symptom, activities of daily living, and SF-36 bodily pain scores (p < 0.05). The MPC + hyaluronan group had reduced medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint space narrowing (p < 0.05), less tibial bone expansion (0.5% vs 4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.02), and a trend towards reduced tibial cartilage volume loss (0.7% vs –4.0% over 26 weeks, p = 0.10) than the hyaluronan controls.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Intra-articular administration of a single allogeneic MPC injection following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was safe, well tolerated, and may improve symptoms and structural outcomes. These findings suggest that mesenchymal precursor cells warrant further investigations as they may modulate some of the pathological processes responsible for the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

2	3511173	PEG-based laxatives	The number of stools/week was 9.2 ± 3.2 (mean ± SD) in the PEG-only group and 7.8 ± 2.4 in the PEG-electrolyte group (p = 0.025); the number of days with stool was 22.4 ± 5.1 in the PEG-only group and 19.6 ± 7.2 in the PEG-electrolyte group (p = 0.034).   TITLE: Efficacy and tolerability of peg-only laxative on faecal impaction and chronic constipation in children. A controlled double blind randomized study vs a standard peg-electrolyte laxative    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  PEG-based laxatives are considered today the gold standard for the treatment of constipation in children. PEG formulations differ in terms of composition of inactive ingredients which may have an impact on acceptance, compliance and adherence to treatment. We therefore compared the efficacy, tolerability, acceptance and compliance of a new PEG-only formulation compared to a reference PEG-electrolyte (PEG-electrolyte) formulation in resolving faecal impaction and in the treatment of chronic constipation.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Children aged 2–16 years with functional chronic constipation for at least 2 months were randomized to receive PEG-only 0.7 g/kg/day in 2 divided doses or 6.9 g PEG-electrolyte 1–4 sachets according to age for 4 weeks. Children with faecal impaction were randomized to receive PEG-only 1.5/g/kg in 2 divided doses until resolution or for 6 days or PEG-electrolyte with an initial dose of 4 sachets and increasing 2 sachets a day until resolution or for 7 days.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Ninety-six children were randomized into the study. Five patients withdrew consent before starting treatment. Three children discontinued treatment for refusal due to bad taste of the product (1 PEG-only, 2 PEG-electrolyte); 1 (PEG-electrolyte) for an adverse effect (abdominal pain). Intent-to-treat analysis was carried out in 49 children in the PEG-only group and 42 in the PEG-electrolyte group.   No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups at baseline.   Adequate relief of constipation in terms of normalized frequency and painless defecation of soft stools was achieved in all patients in both groups. In the PEG-only group faecaloma resolution was observed in 5 children on the second day and in 2 children on the third day, while in the PEG-electrolyte group it was observed in 2 children on the second day, in 3 children on the third day and in 1 child on the fifth day.   Only 2 patients reported mild treatment-related adverse events: 1 child in the PEG-only group had diarrhoea and vomiting and 1 child in the PEG-electrolyte group had abdominal pain requiring treatment discontinuation. The PEG-only preparation was better tolerated as shown by the lower frequency of nausea than in the PEG-electrolyte group.   In the PEG-only group, 96% of patients did not demonstrate any difficulties associated with treatment, as compared with 52% of patients in the PEG-electrolyte group (p < 0.001). Also, the PEG-only formulation taste was better than that of PEG-electrolyte (p < 0.001). The difference between the percentage of subjects who took > 80% of the prescribed dose was in favour of the PEG-only group (98% vs. 88%), though it did not reach a conventional statistical level (p = 0.062).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  PEG-only was better tolerated and accepted than PEG-electrolyte in children with chronic constipation. At the higher PEG doses recommended by the manufactures children in the PEG-only group had higher and more regular soft stool frequency than PEG-electrolyte.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups at baseline.   Adequate relief of constipation in terms of normalized frequency and painless defecation of soft stools was achieved in all patients in both groups. In the PEG-only group faecaloma resolution was observed in 5 children on the second day and in 2 children on the third day, while in the PEG-electrolyte group it was observed in 2 children on the second day, in 3 children on the third day and in 1 child on the fifth day.   Only 2 patients reported mild treatment-related adverse events: 1 child in the PEG-only group had diarrhoea and vomiting and 1 child in the PEG-electrolyte group had abdominal pain requiring treatment discontinuation. The PEG-only preparation was better tolerated as shown by the lower frequency of nausea than in the PEG-electrolyte group.   In the PEG-only group, 96% of patients did not demonstrate any difficulties associated with treatment, as compared with 52% of patients in the PEG-electrolyte group (p < 0.001). Also, the PEG-only formulation taste was better than that of PEG-electrolyte (p < 0.001). The difference between the percentage of subjects who took > 80% of the prescribed dose was in favour of the PEG-only group (98% vs. 88%), though it did not reach a conventional statistical level (p = 0.062).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  PEG-only was better tolerated and accepted than PEG-electrolyte in children with chronic constipation. At the higher PEG doses recommended by the manufactures children in the PEG-only group had higher and more regular soft stool frequency than PEG-electrolyte.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

PEG-based laxatives are considered today the gold standard for the treatment of constipation in children. PEG formulations differ in terms of composition of inactive ingredients which may have an impact on acceptance, compliance and adherence to treatment.

ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Children aged 2–16 years with functional chronic constipation for at least 2 months were randomized to receive PEG-only 0.7 g/kg/day in 2 divided doses or 6.9 g PEG-electrolyte 1–4 sachets according to age for 4 weeks. Children with faecal impaction were randomized to receive PEG-only 1.5/g/kg in 2 divided doses until resolution or for 6 days or PEG-electrolyte with an initial dose of 4 sachets and increasing 2 sachets a day until resolution or for 7 days.

2	4069047	Prolonged-release melatonin	Patients treated with prolonged-release melatonin (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P=0.004) and Mini–Mental State Examination (P=0.044). TITLE: Add-on prolonged-release melatonin for cognitive function and sleep in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease: a 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical Alzheimer's disease stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (prolonged-release melatonin) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of prolonged-release melatonin or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale–Cognition (AD Assessment Scale–Cognition), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), Mini–Mental State Examination (Mini–Mental State Examination), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Mean AD Assessment Scale–Cognition did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, component 4, was also better with prolonged-release melatonin (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ≥6) subgroup, prolonged-release melatonin treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P=0.032), Mini–Mental State Examination score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median AD Assessment Scale–Cognition values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with prolonged-release melatonin. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. prolonged-release melatonin was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Add-on prolonged-release melatonin has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in Alzheimer's disease patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.

ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Mean AD Assessment Scale–Cognition did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, component 4, was also better with prolonged-release melatonin (P=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ≥6) subgroup, prolonged-release melatonin treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P=0.032), Mini–Mental State Examination score (+1.5 versus −3 points) (P=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (P=0.04). Median AD Assessment Scale–Cognition values (−3.5 versus +3 points) (P=0.045) were significantly better with prolonged-release melatonin. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. prolonged-release melatonin was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Add-on prolonged-release melatonin has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in Alzheimer's disease patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.

TITLE: Add-on prolonged-release melatonin for cognitive function and sleep in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease: a 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  A link between poor sleep quality and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease) has recently been suggested. Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical Alzheimer's disease stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (prolonged-release melatonin) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52–85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of prolonged-release melatonin or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo.

2	4968528	diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients (GII)	These differences were statistically significant. TITLE: The association of vitamin D with inflammatory cytokines in diabetic peripheral neuropathy    ABSTRACT.  [Purpose] The effects of vitamin D on the circulating levels of IL-17 and IL-13 were investigated in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 without neuropathy, and healthy controls. [Subjects and Methods] A single-blind controlled clinical study was performed, including70 type 2 diabetic patients with or without diabetic peripheral neuropathy and 33 healthy volunteer controls. The 25(OH)D levels were evaluated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and IL-17 and IL-13 levels were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. [Results] The 25(OH) vitamin D concentration was lower in diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients than in diabetes mellitus patients without neuropathy and healthy controls. Similarly, 25(OH)D levels were lower in diabetes mellitus patients than healthy controls. IL-17 and IL-13 levels were higher in diabetes mellitus patients than in controls. Additionally, IL-13 levels were higher in diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients than in diabetes mellitus patients without neuropathy. There was a significant positive correlation between 25(OH)D and IL-13,and a negative correlation between 25(OH)D andIL-17 in the diabetic and diabetic neuropathy groups. [Conclusion] Vitamin D is a potential modifiable risk factor for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and may regulate inflammatory mediators, e.g., IL-17 and IL-13.

TITLE: Diet and Exercise Interventions among Overweight and Obese Lactating Women: Randomized Trial of Effects on Cardiovascular Risk Factors    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To examine the effects of Diet (Diet) and Exercise (Exercise) interventions on cardiovascular fitness, waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose metabolism, inflammation markers, insulin-like growth factor 1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and blood pressure in overweight and obese lactating women.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  At 10–14 wk postpartum, 68 Swedish women with a self-reported pre-pregnancy BMI of 25–35 kg/m2 were randomized to a 12-wk behavior modification treatment with Diet, Exercise, both or control using a 2×2 factorial design. The goal of Diet treatment was to reduce body weight by 0.5 kg/wk, accomplished by decreasing energy intake by 500 kcal/d and monitoring weight loss through self-weighing. The goal of Exercise treatment was to perform 4 45-min walks per wk at 60–70% of max heart-rate using a heart-rate monitor. Effects were measured 12 wk and 1 y after randomization. General Linear Modeling was used to study main and interaction effects adjusted for baseline values of dependent variable.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The decreased waist circumference (P<0.001) and insulin (P = 0.024) was sustained and HDL-cholesterol increased (P = 0.005) at the 1-y follow-up. No effects from the Exercise treatment or any interaction effects were observed.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Dietary behavior modification that produced sustained weight loss among overweight and obese lactating women also improved risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. This intervention may not only reduce weight-related risks with future pregnancies but also long-term risk for metabolic disease.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01343238

TITLE: The effect of an eye health promotion program on the health protective behaviors of primary school students    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.  Undiagnosed and uncorrected refractive errors in childhood can negatively affect the development of vision and cause students to have low academic success and even quit school before graduation. This study aims to determine the effects of an eye health promotion program on the health protective behaviors of primary school students.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This experimental study using a pretest-posttest design with a control group was conducted in three public primary schools in Aydın, a city in the Western Anatolia Region of Turkey, between April and November 2014. The eye health promotion program was provided by the researchers to the experimental Group 2 days in 4 weeks. The data were analyzed using the t-test, Chi-square analysis, the Mann–Whitney U-test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the McNemar test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The average age of the students was identified as 9.0 ± 3.64 years. The students wearing glasses all in the experimental group and 53.3% in the control group were found to always wear their glasses after the education program was completed (P < 0.05). The eye health protective behaviors of the experimental group were found to have positively changed in the final follow-up, compared to the control group (P < 0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The eye health promotion program was found to be effective in improving eye health protective behaviors within the experimental group.

TITLE: The effect of an eye health promotion program on the health protective behaviors of primary school students    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION:.  Undiagnosed and uncorrected refractive errors in childhood can negatively affect the development of vision and cause students to have low academic success and even quit school before graduation. This study aims to determine the effects of an eye health promotion program on the health protective behaviors of primary school students.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This experimental study using a pretest-posttest design with a control group was conducted in three public primary schools in Aydın, a city in the Western Anatolia Region of Turkey, between April and November 2014.

2	2815285	Lactated Ringer (group II) and hypertonic saline plus dextran (group III)	Volume replacement produced transitory recovery in hemodynamic variables, including mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index, with significant increase in dogs treated with 32 mL/kg of Lactated Ringer's and 7.5% NaCl plus 6.0% dextran 70 (p<0.001, against no treatment), along with a decrease (p<0.001) in the systemic vascular resistance index. TITLE: Blood Loss and Transcapillary Refill in Uncontrolled Treated Hemorrhage in Dogs    ABSTRACT.OBJETIVE:.  This study evaluated retroperitoneal hematomas produced by bilateral injury of iliac arteries (uncontrolled hemorrhage), blood volume loss, transcapillary refill, the effects of volume replacement on retroperitoneal bleeding and the hemodynamic changes with and without treatment.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Initial blood volume was determined with Tc99m-labelled red cells, and bleeding was evaluated by means of a portable scintillation camera positioned over the abdomen. Previously splenectomized mongrel dogs (16.8 ± 2.2 kg) were submitted to hemorrhage for 30 minutes and randomized into three groups: I - no treatment (n=7); II - treatment with 32 mL/kg of Lactated Ringer's for three to five minutes (n=7); and III - treatment with 4 mL/kg of 7.5% NaCl plus 6.0% dextran 70 for three to five minutes (n=7). They were studied for an additional 45 minutes.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Groups II and III had significant initial decreases in hematocrit and hemoglobin. The treated dogs (groups II and III) presented rebleeding, which was greater during treatment with 32 mL/kg of Lactated Ringer's (group II).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Despite the rebleeding observed in treated groups, the utilization of hypertonic saline solution with dextran proved to be effective in the initial reanimation, producing evident transcapillary refill, while the Lactated Ringer's solution produced capillary extravasation and was ineffective in the initial volume replacement in this model of uncontrolled hemorrhage.

2	4759860	L-citrulline	Moreover, L-citrulline significantly improved subjective feelings of muscle fatigue and concentration immediately after exercise.   TITLE: Oral L-citrulline supplementation enhances cycling time trial performance in healthy trained men: Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled 2-way crossover study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Many human studies report that nitric oxide (nitric oxide) improves sport performance. This is because nitric oxide is a potential modulator of blood flow, muscle energy metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration during exercise. L-Citrulline is an amino acid present in the body and is a potent endogenous precursor of L-arginine, which is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase. Here, we investigated the effect of oral L-citrulline supplementation on cycling time trial performance in humans.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled 2-way crossover study was employed. Twenty-two trained males consumed 2.4 g/day of L-citrulline or placebo orally for 7 days. On Day 8 they took 2.4 g of L-citrulline or placebo 1 h before a 4-km cycling time trial. Time taken to complete the 4 km cycle, along with power output/VO2 ratio (power output/VO2 ratio), plasma nitrite and nitrate (NOx) and amino acid levels, and visual analog scale (visual analog scale) scores, was evaluated.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  L-Citrulline supplementation significantly increased plasma L-arginine levels and reduced completion time by 1.5 % (p < 0.05) compared with placebo. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Oral L-citrulline supplementation reduced the time take to complete a cycle ergometer exercise trial.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  Current Controlled Trials UMIN000014278.

TITLE: Evaluation of Consumer Understanding of Different Front-of-Package Nutrition Labels, 2010–2011    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  Governments throughout the world are using or considering various front-of-package (front-of-package) food labeling systems to provide nutrition information to consumers. Our web-based study tested consumer understanding of different front-of-package labeling systems.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Adult participants (N = 480) were randomized to 1 of 5 groups to evaluate front-of-package labels: 1) no label; 2) multiple traffic light (multiple traffic light); 3) multiple traffic light plus daily caloric requirement icon (MTL+caloric intake); 4) traffic light with specific nutrients to limit based on food category (TL+SNL); or 5) the Choices logo. Total percentage correct quiz scores were created reflecting participants' ability to select the healthier of 2 foods and estimate amounts of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium in foods. Participants also rated products on taste, healthfulness, and how likely they were to purchase the product. Quiz scores and product perceptions were compared with 1-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Tukey tests.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The multiple traffic light and MTL+caloric intake groups achieved average scores of more than 90% on the saturated fat, sugar, and sodium quizzes, which were significantly better than the no label and Choices group average scores, which were between 34% and 47%.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  An MTL+caloric intake label and the Choices symbol hold promise as front-of-package labeling systems and require further testing in different environments and population subgroups.

Adult participants (N = 480) were randomized to 1 of 5 groups to evaluate front-of-package labels: 1) no label; 2) multiple traffic light (multiple traffic light); 3) multiple traffic light plus daily caloric requirement icon (MTL+caloric intake); 4) traffic light with specific nutrients to limit based on food category (TL+SNL); or 5) the Choices logo. Total percentage correct quiz scores were created reflecting participants' ability to select the healthier of 2 foods and estimate amounts of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium in foods. Participants also rated products on taste, healthfulness, and how likely they were to purchase the product. Quiz scores and product perceptions were compared with 1-way analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Tukey tests.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The MTL+caloric intake group (mean [standard deviation], 73.3% [6.9%]) and Choices group (72.5% [13.2%]) significantly outperformed the no label group (67.8% [10.3%]) and the TL+SNL group (65.8% [7.3%]) in selecting the more healthful product on the healthier product quiz. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  An MTL+caloric intake label and the Choices symbol hold promise as front-of-package labeling systems and require further testing in different environments and population subgroups.

TITLE: A Capsaicin (8%) Patch in the Treatment of Severe Persistent Inguinal Postherniorrhaphy Pain: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Persistent pain after inguinal herniorrhaphy is a disabling condition with a lack of evidence-based pharmacological treatment options. This randomized placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of a capsaicin 8% cutaneous patch in the treatment of severe persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Forty-six patients with persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain were randomized to receive either a capsaicin 8% patch or a placebo patch. Pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS 0–10]) was evaluated under standardized conditions (at rest, during movement, and during pressure) at baseline and at 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application. Skin punch biopsies for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (intraepidermal nerve fiber density) measurements were taken at baseline and 1 month after patch application. Quantitative sensory testing was performed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 months after patch application. The primary outcome was comparisons of summed pain intensity differences (summed pain intensity differences) between capsaicin and placebo treatments at 1, 2 and 3 months after patch application (significance level P<0.01).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The maximum difference in SPID, between capsaicin and placebo treatments, was observed at 1 month after patch application, but the pain reduction was not significant (NRS, mean difference [95% CI]: 5.0 [0.09 to 9.9]; P = 0.046). Changes in intraepidermal nerve fiber density on the pain side, from baseline to 1 month after patch application, did not differ between capsaicin and placebo treatment: 1.9 [−0.1 to 3.9] and 0.6 [−1.2 to 2.5] fibers/mm, respectively (P = 0.32). No significant changes in sensory function, sleep quality or psychological factors were associated with capsaicin patch treatment.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The study did not demonstrate significant differences in pain relief between capsaicin and placebo treatment, although a trend toward pain improvement in capsaicin treated patients was observed 1 month after patch application.

2	3685524	Wood smoke	Central arterial stiffness, measured as augmentation index, augmentation pressure and pulse wave velocity, was higher after wood smoke exposure as compared to filtered air (p < 0.01 for all), and heart rate was increased (p < 0.01) although there was no effect on blood pressure. TITLE: Exposure to wood smoke increases arterial stiffness and decreases heart rate variability in humans    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Emissions from biomass combustion are a major source of indoor and outdoor air pollution, and are estimated to cause millions of premature deaths worldwide annually. Whilst adverse respiratory health effects of biomass exposure are well established, less is known about its effects on the cardiovascular system. In this study we assessed the effect of exposure to wood smoke on heart rate, blood pressure, central arterial stiffness and heart rate variability in otherwise healthy persons.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Fourteen healthy non-smoking subjects participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study. Subjects were exposed to dilute wood smoke (mean particle concentration of 314±38 μg/m3) or filtered air for three hours during intermittent exercise. Heart rate, blood pressure, central arterial stiffness and heart rate variability were measured at baseline and for one hour post-exposure.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Heart rate variability (SDNN, RMSSD and pNN50; p = 0.003, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively) was decreased one hour following exposure to wood smoke compared to filtered air.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Acute exposure to wood smoke as a model of exposure to biomass combustion is associated with an immediate increase in central arterial stiffness and a simultaneous reduction in heart rate variability. As biomass is used for cooking and heating by a large fraction of the global population and is currently advocated as a sustainable alternative energy source, further studies are required to establish its likely impact on cardiovascular disease.

The median interquartile range pain score is worst for placebo group after LAI (5 [3-6]) and in the immediate postprocedure period (5 [4-5]) which was significantly attenuated by addition of fentanyl (3.5 [2-5] and 3 [2-4]) (P = 0.009 and 0.001 respectively). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Preprocedural bolus fentanyl infusion provides adequate analgesia and can be safely used for alleviating pain during Central venous catheter insertion in conscious patients.

TITLE: A Randomized Controlled Phase IIb Trial of Antigen-Antibody Immunogenic Complex Therapeutic Vaccine in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The safety of the immune complexes composed of yeast-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen) and antibodies (abbreviated as YIC) among healthy adults and chronic hepatitis B patients has been proved in phase I and phase IIa trial. A larger number of patients for study of dosage and efficacy are therefore needed.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS.  Two hundred forty two HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients were immunized with six injections of either 30 μg YIC, 60 μg of YIC or alum adjuvant as placebo at four-week intervals under code. HBV markers and HBV DNA were monitored during immunization and 24 weeks after the completion of immunization. The primary endpoint was defined as loss of HBeAg, or presence of anti-HBe antibody or suppression of HBV DNA, while the secondary endpoint was both HBeAg seroconversion and suppression of HBV DNA. Using generalized estimating equations (generalized estimating equations) model, a significant difference of group effects was found between 60 μg YIC and the placebo groups in terms of the primary endpoint. Eleven serious adverse events occurred, which were 5.1%, 3.6%, and 5.0% in the placebo, 30 μg YIC and 60 μg YIC groups respectively (p>0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Though statistical differences in the preset primary and secondary endpoints among the three groups were not reached, a late and promising HBeAg seroconversion effect was shown in the 60 μg YIC immunized regimen. By increasing the number of patients and injections, the therapeutic efficacy of YIC in chronic hepatitis B patients will be further evaluated.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

2	5409660	Dry-cured ham	Results: The mean differences between dry-cured ham and cooked ham followed by a time period adjustment for plasmatic P-selectin and interleukin 6 proteins slightly failed (p = 0.062 and p = 0.049, respectively), notably increased for MCP-1 levels (p = 0.023) while VCAM-1 was not affected. TITLE: The Effect of Regular Intake of Dry-Cured Ham Rich in Bioactive Peptides on Inflammation, Platelet and Monocyte Activation Markers in Humans    ABSTRACT.  Background and aims: Dietary studies have shown that active biopeptides provide protective health benefits, although the mediating pathways are somewhat uncertain. To throw light on this situation, we studied the effects of consuming Spanish dry-cured ham on platelet function, monocyte activation markers and the inflammatory status of healthy humans with pre-hypertension. Methods: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers with systolic blood pressure of >125 mmHg were enrolled in a two-arm crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants received 80 g/day dry-cured pork ham of >11 months proteolysis or 100 g/day cooked ham (control product) for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week washout before "crossing over" to the other treatment for 4 more weeks. Soluble markers and cytokines were analyzed by ELISA. Platelet function was assessed by measuring P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding after adenosine diphosphate (adenosine diphosphate) stimulation using whole blood flow cytometry. Monocyte markers of the pathological status (adhesion, inflammatory and scavenging receptors) were also measured by flow cytometry in the three monocyte subsets after the interventional period. Platelet function also decreased after adenosine diphosphate stimulation. The expression of adhesion and scavenging markers (ICAM1R, CXCR4 and TLR4) in the three subsets of monocytes was significantly higher (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The regular consumption of biopeptides contained in the dry-cured ham but absent in cooked ham impaired platelet and monocyte activation and the levels of plasmatic P-selectin, MCP-1 and interleukin 6 in healthy subjects. This study strongly suggests the existence of a mechanism that links dietary biopeptides and beneficial health effects.

Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of ginger extract, or Zingiber officinale, on the cognitive function of middle-aged, healthy women. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or standardized plant extract at doses of 400 and 800 mg once daily for 2 months. They were evaluated for working memory and cognitive function using computerized battery tests and the auditory oddball paradigm of event-related potentials at three different time periods: before receiving the intervention, one month, and two months. Therefore, ginger is a potential cognitive enhancer for middle-aged women.

2	3161280	insulin glargine over 8 weeks	Fasting glycemia was lowered from 179.6 ± 7.5 to 117.6 ± 6.5 mg/dL (P < 0.001), and HbA1c levels declined from 8.4 ± 0.5 to 7.1 ± 0.2% (P = 0.0046). TITLE: Chronic Reduction of Fasting Glycemia With Insulin Glargine Improves First- and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  Insulin secretion is often diminished in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether chronic basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine improves glucose-induced insulin secretion.   ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.  Fourteen patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy received an add-on therapy with insulin glargine over 8 weeks. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (Intravenous glucose tolerance tests) were performed before and after the intervention, with and without previous adjustment of fasting glucose levels using a 3-h intravenous insulin infusion.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The final insulin dose was 59.3 ± 10.2 IU. Acute normalization of fasting glycemia by intravenous insulin reduced C-peptide levels during the IVGTT (P < 0.0001). In contrast, insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose administration were significantly greater after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.0001, respectively). Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion increased significantly after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.05, respectively). These improvements in insulin secretion were observed during both the experiments with and without acute adjustment of fasting glycemia.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Chronic supplementation of long-acting basal insulin improves glucose-induced insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas acute exogenous insulin administration reduces the β-cell response to glucose administration.

TITLE: Chronic Reduction of Fasting Glycemia With Insulin Glargine Improves First- and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  Insulin secretion is often diminished in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes. We examined whether chronic basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine improves glucose-induced insulin secretion.   ABSTRACT.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS.  Fourteen patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy received an add-on therapy with insulin glargine over 8 weeks. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (Intravenous glucose tolerance tests) were performed before and after the intervention, with and without previous adjustment of fasting glucose levels using a 3-h intravenous insulin infusion.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The final insulin dose was 59.3 ± 10.2 IU. Acute normalization of fasting glycemia by intravenous insulin reduced C-peptide levels during the IVGTT (P < 0.0001). In contrast, insulin and C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose administration were significantly greater after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.0001, respectively). Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion increased significantly after the glargine treatment period (P < 0.05, respectively). These improvements in insulin secretion were observed during both the experiments with and without acute adjustment of fasting glycemia.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Chronic supplementation of long-acting basal insulin improves glucose-induced insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas acute exogenous insulin administration reduces the β-cell response to glucose administration. These data provide a rationale for basal insulin treatment regiments to improve postprandial endogenous insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes.

Patients who had received dexamethasone + epinephrine exhibited similar admission rates compared to placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.64). TITLE: Effect of combined dexamethasone therapy with nebulized r-epinephrine or salbutamol in infants with bronchiolitis: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  This study investigated the effect of combining oral dexamethasone with either nebulized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol compared to bronchodilators alone for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial on infants (1 to 12 months) who were diagnosed in the emergency department with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period. Infants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to four groups: A (dexamethasone + racemic epinephrine) = 45, B (placebo and racemic epinephrine) =39, C (dexamethasone and salbutamol) = 40, or D (placebo and salbutamol) = 38.   Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51). Clinical parameters were improved at the end of the 4-hour observation period for all treatment groups. Treatment with dexamethasone + epinephrine resulted in a statistically significant change in HR over time (P < 0.005) compared to the other groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  This study adds to a body of evidence suggesting that corticosteroids have no role in the management of bronchiolitis for young infants who are first time wheezers with no risk of atopy.

TITLE: Effect of combined dexamethasone therapy with nebulized r-epinephrine or salbutamol in infants with bronchiolitis: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  This study investigated the effect of combining oral dexamethasone with either nebulized racemic epinephrine or salbutamol compared to bronchodilators alone for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial on infants (1 to 12 months) who were diagnosed in the emergency department with moderate-to-severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was the rate of hospital admission within 7 days of the first dose of treatment, and the secondary outcomes were changes in respiratory distress assessment instrument score, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (O2 Sat) over a 4-hour observation period. Infants (n = 162) were randomly assigned to four groups: A (dexamethasone + racemic epinephrine) = 45, B (placebo and racemic epinephrine) =39, C (dexamethasone and salbutamol) = 40, or D (placebo and salbutamol) = 38.   Similarly, no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of hospitalization for patients who received dexamethasone + salbutamol compared to those who received placebo + epinephrine or salbutamol (P = 0.51). Clinical parameters were improved at the end of the 4-hour observation period for all treatment groups.

TITLE: XELIRI-bevacizumab versus FOLFIRI-bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group phase III trial with collateral biomarker analysis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The aim was to compare two standard chemotherapy regimens combined with bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients previously untreated for metastatic disease were randomized in: group A (irinotecan, capecitabine, bevacizumab, every 3 weeks; XELIRI-bevacizumab) and group B (irinotecan, leucovorin, fluorouracil, bevacizumab, every 2 weeks; FOLFIRI-bevacizumab). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (progression-free survival). Plasma concentrations of nitric oxide, osteopontin, TGF-β1 and VEGF-A were measured at baseline and during treatment.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Among 285 eligible patients, 143 were randomized to group A and 142 to group B. Fifty-five patients (38.5%) in group A and 57 (40.1%) in group B responded (p = 0.81). Most frequent grade 3–4 toxicities (group A vs group B) were neutropenia (13% vs 22%, p = 0.053) and diarrhea (19% vs 11%, p = 0.082). Baseline plasma osteopontin concentrations demonstrated prognostic significance for both progression-free survival and OS.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This trial did not show significant differences in efficacy between the groups. However, the toxicity profile was different. Baseline plasma osteopontin concentrations demonstrated independent prognostic significance. (Registration number: ACTRN12610000270011)

2	5846302	VerisetTM hemostatic patch	Serious adverse events within 30 days post-surgery were experienced by 12/44 (27.3%) patients treated with VerisetTM hemostatic patch and 10/45 (22.2%) in the TachoSil® group (p=0.6295). TITLE: A randomized, controlled trial of Veriset™ hemostatic patch in halting cardiovascular bleeding    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Obtaining hemostasis during cardiovascular procedures can be a challenge, particularly around areas with a complex geometry or that are difficult to access. While several topical hemostats are currently on the market, most have caveats that limit their use in certain clinical scenarios such as pulsatile arterial bleeding. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of VerisetTM hemostatic patch in treating cardiovascular bleeding.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients (N=90) scheduled for cardiac or vascular surgery at 12 European institutions were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either VerisetTM hemostatic patch (investigational device) or TachoSil® (control). After application of the hemostat, according to manufacturer instructions for use, time to hemostasis was monitored. Follow-up occurred up to 90 days post-surgery.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Median time to hemostasis was 1.5 min with VerisetTM hemostatic patch, compared to 3.0 min with TachoSil® (p<0.0001). None of these adverse events were device-related, and no reoperations for bleeding were required within 5 days post-surgery in either treatment group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study reinforces the difference in minimum recommended application time between VerisetTM hemostatic patch and TachoSil® (30 s versus 3 min respectively). When compared directly at 3 min, VerisetTM displayed no significant difference, showing similar hemostasis and safety profiles on the cardiovascular bleeding sites included in this study.

2	3730064	2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1)	In group I, the preoperative corneal neovascularization area (8.75 ± 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 ± 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 ± 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). TITLE: The Effect of Bevacizumab versus Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Corneal Neovascularization: A Preliminary Study    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To compare the short term effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections on the regression of corneal neovascularization (neovascularization).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with corneal neovascularization were randomly assigned for an injection with 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1, n = 8) or 1 mg of ranibizumab (group 2, n = 8) through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes. The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal neovascularization areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal neovascularization areas were compared before and after the injections.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Seven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal neovascularization secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). The corneal neovascularization area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 ± 4.33% to 6.72 ± 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal neovascularization area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 ± 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 ± 11.64%, p = 0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Bevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal neovascularization compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal neovascularization require further investigation.
1	3730064	baseline	In group I, the preoperative corneal neovascularization area (8.75 ± 4.33%) was significantly decreased to 5.62 ± 3.86% one week after the injection and to 6.35 ± 3.02% one month after the injection (p = 0.012, 0.012, respectively). TITLE: The Effect of Bevacizumab versus Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Corneal Neovascularization: A Preliminary Study    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To compare the short term effects of bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections on the regression of corneal neovascularization (neovascularization).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with corneal neovascularization were randomly assigned for an injection with 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (group 1, n = 8) or 1 mg of ranibizumab (group 2, n = 8) through subconjunctival and intrastromal routes. The patients were prospectively followed-up for one month after the injections. Corneal neovascularization areas, as shown on corneal slit-lamp photographs stored in JPEG format, were calculated using Image J software before the injection, one week after the injection, and one month after the injection. The corneal neovascularization areas were compared before and after the injections.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Seven women and nine men, with an average age of 51 years, presented with corneal neovascularization secondary to herpetic keratitis (7 cases), graft rejection (6), chemical burn (1), pemphigoid (1), and recurrent ulcer (1). The corneal neovascularization area in group 2 also exhibited a significant change, from 7.37 ± 4.33% to 6.72 ± 4.16% one week after the injection (p = 0.012). However, no significant change was observed one month after the injection. The mean decrease in corneal neovascularization area one month after injection in group 1 (28.4 ± 9.01%) was significantly higher than in group 2 (4.51 ± 11.64%, p = 0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Bevacizumab injection resulted in a more effective and stable regression of corneal neovascularization compared to the ranibizumab injection. The potency and dose of these two drugs for the regression of corneal neovascularization require further investigation.

TITLE: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the addition of methotrexate to etanercept in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Etanercept plus methotrexate combination therapy has not been adequately investigated in psoriasis.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  To evaluate etanercept plus methotrexate vs. etanercept monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had not failed prior methotrexate or tumour necrosis factor-inhibitor therapy.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients received etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks followed by 50 mg once weekly for 12 weeks and were randomized 1 : 1 to receive methotrexate (7·5–15 mg weekly) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving ≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 24.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In total, 239 patients were enrolled in each arm. Other PASI improvement scores at week 12 [PASI 75, 70·2% vs. 54·3% (P = 0·01); PASI 50, 92·4% vs. 83·8% (P = 0·01); and PASI 90, 34·0% vs. 23·1% (P = 0·03)] showed similar results as did week 24 PASI 50 (91·6% vs. 84·6%; P = 0·01) and PASI 90 (53·8% vs. 34·2%; P = 0·01). Significantly more patients receiving combination therapy than monotherapy had static Physician's Global Assessment of clear/almost clear at week 12 (65·5% vs. 47·0%; P = 0·01) and week 24 (71·8% vs. 54·3%; P = 0·01). Adverse events (Adverse events) were reported in 74·9% and 59·8% of combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively; three serious Adverse events were reported in each arm.

2	4129110	high-intensity functional training (high-intensity functional training)	high-intensity functional training participants spent significantly less time exercising per week, yet were able to maintain exercise enjoyment and were more likely to intend to continue. TITLE: High-intensity compared to moderate-intensity training for exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions: an intervention study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Understanding exercise participation for overweight and obese adults is critical for preventing comorbid conditions. Group-based high-intensity functional training (high-intensity functional training) provides time-efficient aerobic and resistance exercise at self-selected intensity levels which can increase adherence; behavioral responses to high-intensity functional training are unknown. This study examined effects of high-intensity functional training as compared to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (and resistance training) on exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A stratified, randomized two-group pre-test posttest intervention was conducted for eight weeks in 2012 with analysis in 2013. Participants (n = 23) were stratified by median age (< or ≥ 28) and body mass index (body mass index; < or ≥ 30.5). Participants were physically inactive with an average body mass index of 31.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2, body fat percentage of 42.0 ± 7.4%, weight of 89.5 ± 14.2 kg, and ages 26.8 ± 5.9 years. Most participants were white, college educated, female, and married/engaged. Both groups completed 3 training sessions per week. The and resistance training group completed 50 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each session and full-body resistance training on two sessions per week. The high-intensity functional training group completed 60-minute sessions of CrossFitTM with actual workouts ranging from 5–30 minutes.

TITLE: High-intensity compared to moderate-intensity training for exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions: an intervention study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Understanding exercise participation for overweight and obese adults is critical for preventing comorbid conditions. Group-based high-intensity functional training (high-intensity functional training) provides time-efficient aerobic and resistance exercise at self-selected intensity levels which can increase adherence; behavioral responses to high-intensity functional training are unknown. This study examined effects of high-intensity functional training as compared to moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training (and resistance training) on exercise initiation, enjoyment, adherence, and intentions.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A stratified, randomized two-group pre-test posttest intervention was conducted for eight weeks in 2012 with analysis in 2013. Participants (n = 23) were stratified by median age (< or ≥ 28) and body mass index (body mass index; < or ≥ 30.5). Participants were physically inactive with an average body mass index of 31.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2, body fat percentage of 42.0 ± 7.4%, weight of 89.5 ± 14.2 kg, and ages 26.8 ± 5.9 years. Most participants were white, college educated, female, and married/engaged. Both groups completed 3 training sessions per week. The and resistance training group completed 50 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise each session and full-body resistance training on two sessions per week. The high-intensity functional training group completed 60-minute sessions of CrossFitTM with actual workouts ranging from 5–30 minutes. Participants completed baseline and posttest questionnaires indicating reasons for exercise initiation (baseline), exercise enjoyment, and exercise intentions (posttest).

TITLE: A multicentre, randomised, controlled trial to assess the safety, ease of use, and reliability of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder adhesion barrier versus no barrier in colorectal laparoscopic surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Intra-peritoneal adhesions are frequent following abdominal surgery and are the most common cause of small bowel obstructions. A hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose (hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose) film adhesion barrier has been shown to reduce adhesion formation in abdominal surgery. An hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder formulation was developed for application during laparoscopic procedures.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was an exploratory, prospective, randomised, single-blind, parallel-group, Phase IIIb, multicentre study conducted at 15 hospitals in France to assess the safety of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder versus no adhesion barrier following laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Subjects ≥18 years of age who were scheduled for colorectal laparoscopy (Mangram contamination class I‒III) within 8 weeks of selection were eligible, regardless of aetiology. Participants were randomised 1:1 to the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder or no adhesion barrier group using a centralised randomisation list. Patients assigned to hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder received a single application of 1 to 10 g on adhesion-prone areas. In the no adhesion barrier group, no adhesion barrier or placebo was applied. The primary safety assessments were the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and surgical site infections (surgical site infections) for 30 days following surgery. Between-group comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Of those randomised to the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder (n = 105) or no adhesion barrier (n = 104) groups, one patient in each group discontinued prior to the study end (one death in each group). There were no statistically significant differences between the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder group and the no adhesion barrier group in surgical site infections (21% vs. 14%; P = 0.216) and serious surgical site infections (12% vs. 9%; P = 0.38), or in the most frequent serious surgical site infections of pelvic abscess (5% and 2%; significance not tested), anastomotic fistula (3% and 4%), and peritonitis (2% and 3%).

TITLE: A multicentre, randomised, controlled trial to assess the safety, ease of use, and reliability of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder adhesion barrier versus no barrier in colorectal laparoscopic surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Intra-peritoneal adhesions are frequent following abdominal surgery and are the most common cause of small bowel obstructions. A hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose (hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose) film adhesion barrier has been shown to reduce adhesion formation in abdominal surgery. An hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder formulation was developed for application during laparoscopic procedures.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was an exploratory, prospective, randomised, single-blind, parallel-group, Phase IIIb, multicentre study conducted at 15 hospitals in France to assess the safety of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder versus no adhesion barrier following laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Subjects ≥18 years of age who were scheduled for colorectal laparoscopy (Mangram contamination class I‒III) within 8 weeks of selection were eligible, regardless of aetiology. Participants were randomised 1:1 to the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder or no adhesion barrier group using a centralised randomisation list. Patients assigned to hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder received a single application of 1 to 10 g on adhesion-prone areas. In the no adhesion barrier group, no adhesion barrier or placebo was applied. The primary safety assessments were the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and surgical site infections (surgical site infections) for 30 days following surgery. Between-group comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Of those randomised to the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder (n = 105) or no adhesion barrier (n = 104) groups, one patient in each group discontinued prior to the study end (one death in each group). There were no statistically significant differences between the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose powder group and the no adhesion barrier group in surgical site infections (21% vs. 14%; P = 0.216) and serious surgical site infections (12% vs. 9%; P = 0.38), or in the most frequent serious surgical site infections of pelvic abscess (5% and 2%; significance not tested), anastomotic fistula (3% and 4%), and peritonitis (2% and 3%).

TITLE: Randomized study of continuous high-dose lenalidomide, sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide, or azacitidine in persons 65 years and over with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia    ABSTRACT.  Therapy of acute myeloid leukemia in older persons is associated with poor outcomes because of intolerance to intensive therapy, resistant disease and co-morbidities. This multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase II trial compared safety and efficacy of three therapeutic strategies in patients 65 years or over with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia: 1) continuous high-dose lenalidomide (n=15); 2) sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide (n=39); and 3) azacitidine only (n=34). The efficacy end point was 1-year survival. Median age was 76 years (range 66–87 years). Thirteen subjects (15%) had prior myelodysplastic syndrome and 41 (47%) had adverse cytogenetics. One-year survival was 21% [95% confidence interval (confidence interval): 0, 43%] with high-dose lenalidomide, 44% (95%CI: 28, 60%) with sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide, and 52% (95%CI: 35, 70%) with azacitidine only. Lenalidomide at a continuous high-dose schedule was poorly-tolerated resulting in a high rate of early therapy discontinuations. These data do not favor use of continuous high-dose lenalidomide or sequential azacitidine and lenalidomide over the conventional dose and schedule of azacitidine only in patients aged 65 years or over with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

TITLE: Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lispro and Aspart Evaluated by Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.   To compare the effect of the rapid-acting insulin analogues (rapid-acting insulin analogues) aspart (NovoRapid) and lispro (Prandilin) on glycemic variations by continuous glucose monitoring system (continuous glucose monitoring system) in patients within newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus) receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) and metformin intensive therapy.    ABSTRACT.METHODS.   This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. A total of 110 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus and with hemoglobin A1c (hemoglobin A1c) above 9% was hospitalized and randomly divided into two groups: group Asp (NovoRapid group) and group Lis (Prandilin group). They all received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and metformin therapy. Treatments were maintained for 2-3 weeks after the glycaemic target was reached. C-peptide and insulin and fructosamine were determined. continuous glucose monitoring system was continuously applied for 4 days after reaching the glycemic target.    ABSTRACT.RESULTS.   No significant differences were seen in the 24 h mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (mean amplitude of glycemic excursions), 24 h mean blood glucose (mean blood glucose), the standard deviation of the mean blood glucose (SDBG), fasting blood glucose, number of glycemic excursion (number of glycemic excursion), and the incidence of hypoglycemia between the two groups. Similarly, no significant differences were found in areas under the curve (areas under the curve) of glucose above 10.0 mmol/L or the decremental area over the curve (area over the curve) of glucose below 3.9 mmol/L between the two groups.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the stress response after metal cup versus Kiwi Omnicup® ventouse delivery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study was a secondary observational analysis of data from a former prospective randomised placebo controlled multicentre study on the analgesic effect of acetaminophen in neonates after operative vaginal delivery and took place at three Swiss tertiary hospitals. Healthy pregnant women ≥35 weeks of gestation with an estimated fetal birth weight above 2000 g were recruited after admission to the labour ward. Pain reaction was analysed by pain expression score EDIN scale (Échelle Douleur Inconfort Nouveau-Né, neonatal pain and discomfort scale) directly after delivery. For measurement of the biochemical stress response, salivary cortisol as well as the Bernese Pain Scale of Newborns (Bernese Pain Scale of Newborns) were evaluated before and after an acute pain stimulus (the standard heel prick for metabolic testing (Guthrie test)) at 48–72 h.  ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Neonatal pain response is slightly reduced after use of Kiwi OmniCup® versus metal cup ventouse.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  Trial was registered under under NCT00488540 on 19th June 2007.

2	4877819	Andrographis paniculata	Patients treated with A. paniculata showed a significant reduction in their Fatigue Severity Scores score as compared to the placebo, equivalent to a 44 % reduction at 12 months. TITLE:     ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata), a medicinal plant, has shown anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antifibrotic effects in animal models as well as clinical efficacy in different studies, including an anti-fatigue effect in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In multiple sclerosis (multiple sclerosis), fatigue is rated as one of the most common and disabling symptoms. In the present trial, we investigated the effect of A. paniculata on relapse rate and fatigue in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting MS) patients receiving interferon beta.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of 170 mg of A. paniculata dried extract tablet b.i.d. p.o. on relapse rate and fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scores (Fatigue Severity Scores) over 12 months in relapsing-remitting MS patients receiving interferon. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (Expanded Disability Status Scale) score, inflammatory parameters and radiological findings were also investigated. Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and twenty-two patients were ultimately analysed and randomised to the active or placebo group.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  No statistically significant differences were observed for relapse rate, Expanded Disability Status Scale or inflammatory parameters, with a trend in reducing new lesions among the A. paniculata group. One patient in the A. paniculata group presented with a mild and transient skin rash, which was alleviated with anti-histamine treatment for three weeks.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  A. paniculata was well tolerated in patients and no changes in clinical parameters were observed. A. paniculata significantly reduces fatigue in patients with relapsing-remitting MS receiving interferon beta in comparison to placebo and only interferon beta treatment.

2	3620559	20 G/ 35 mm (thin) needle	The standard diameter needle was used to collect a total of 215 oocytes from 355 aspirated follicles (60.6%) compared to 203 oocytes from 352 aspirated follicles (57.7%) with the thinner needle (p = 0.23). TITLE: A pilot trial of large versus small diameter needles for oocyte retrieval    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  This study was designed to determine whether small diameter needles for oocyte retrieval alter oocyte yields in patients undergoing IVF in comparison to standard large diameter needles.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  We conducted a prospective pilot study of 21 consecutive favorable prognosis patients. In each patient one ovary was randomly allocated to retrieval with either a 20 G/ 35 mm (thin) or 17 G/ 35 mm (standard) needle, the other ovary was then retrieved with the opposite needle.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Stratifying outcomes by anti-Müllerian hormone (anti-Müllerian hormone), as indicator of ovarian reserve, and by body mass index (body mass index) the oocyte yields, still, did not differ (anti-Müllerian hormone, r (17) = −0.20, p = 0.44; body mass index, r (17) =0.02, p = 0.96). Outcomes also did not vary among women with diminished ovarian reserve (p = 0.17) and in women with normal ovarian reserve (p = 1.00). Operating time was, however, significantly increased by 3.3 minutes per ovary (z = −3.08, p = 0.002) with the thinner needle.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Needle diameter does not affect oocyte yield, including in obese patients and patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Thinner needles appear to significantly prolong operating time.

TITLE: Decreased Body Mass Index in Schoolchildren After Yearlong Information Sessions With Parents Reinforced With Web and Mobile Phone Resources: Community Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The obesity pandemic has now reached children, and households should change their lifestyles to prevent it.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The objective was to assess the effect of a comprehensive intervention on body mass index z-score (body mass index z-score) in schoolchildren.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A yearlong study was conducted at 4 elementary schools in Mexico City. Intervention group (Intervention group) and control group (control group) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults.

We measured their weight and height and calculated body mass index z-score at 0, 6, and 12 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The control group children showed a change of +0.06 (95% CI 0.01, 0.11) and +0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.10) in their body mass index z-score at 6 and 12 months, respectively. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The comprehensive intervention tested had beneficial effects, preserved the body mass index z-score of normal weight children, and reduced the body mass index z-score of children with obesity.

TITLE: Decreased Body Mass Index in Schoolchildren After Yearlong Information Sessions With Parents Reinforced With Web and Mobile Phone Resources: Community Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The obesity pandemic has now reached children, and households should change their lifestyles to prevent it.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The objective was to assess the effect of a comprehensive intervention on body mass index z-score (body mass index z-score) in schoolchildren.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A yearlong study was conducted at 4 elementary schools in Mexico City. Intervention group (Intervention group) and control group (control group) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults. Text messages were sent to parents' mobile phones reinforcing the information provided. The Intervention group contained 226 children and control group 181 children. We measured their weight and height and calculated body mass index z-score at 0, 6, and 12 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The control group children showed a change of +0.06 (95% CI 0.01, 0.11) and +0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.10) in their body mass index z-score at 6 and 12 months, respectively. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The comprehensive intervention tested had beneficial effects, preserved the body mass index z-score of normal weight children, and reduced the body mass index z-score of children with obesity.
2	2966708	Laparoscopic hysterectomy	The peak serum interleukin-6 (P < 0.05) and CRP concentrations were significantly less increased in the laparoscopic group as compared with that of the abdominal hysterectomy group (P < 0.05), while the serum cortisol concentration showed a similar time course and changes and there were no significant difference between the groups. TITLE: Comparison of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses after laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Laparoscopic surgery is associated with a more favorable clinical outcome than that of conventional open surgery. This might be related to the magnitude of the tissue trauma. The aim of the present study was to examine the differences of the neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses between the two surgical techniques.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Twenty-four patients with no major medical disease were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (n = 13) or abdominal hysterectomy (n = 11). Venous blood samples were collected and we measured the levels of interleukin-6 (interleukin-6), CRP and cortisol at the time before and after skin incision, at the end of peritoneum closure and at 1 h and 24 h after operation.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The laparoscopic hysterectomy group demonstrated less of an inflammatory response in terms of the serum interleukin-6 and CRP responses than did the abdominal hysterectomy group, and the laparoscopic hysterectomy group had a shorter hospital stay (P < 0.05). The response of interleukin-6 showed a significant correlation with the response of CRP (r = 0.796; P < 0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The laparoscopic surgical procedure leaves the endocrine metabolic response largely unaltered as compared with that of open abdominal hysterectomy, but it reduces the inflammatory response as measured by the interleukin-6 and CRP levels.

TITLE: The usability and preliminary effectiveness of a web-based physical activity intervention in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  A large proportion of patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis) do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity (physical activity). Therefore, we developed a web-based intervention that provides a tailored physical activity program for patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis, entitled Join2move. The intervention incorporates core principles of the behaviour graded activity theory (behaviour graded activity theory). The aim of this study was to investigate the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of Join2move in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A non-randomized pilot study was performed among patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Primary outcomes were physical activity (SQUASH Questionnaire), physical function (HOOS and KOOS questionnaires) and self-perceived effect (7-point Likert scale). Baseline, 6 and 12 week follow-up data were collected via online questionnaires. To assess feasibility and acceptability, program usage (modules completed) and user satisfaction (SUS questionnaire) were measured as secondary outcomes. Participants from the pilot study were invited to be interviewed. The interviews focused on users' experiences with Join2move. Besides the pilot study we performed two usability tests to determine the feasibility and acceptability of Join2move. In the first usability test, software experts evaluated the website from a list of usability concepts. In the second test, users were asked to verbalize thoughts during the execution of multiple tasks.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Twenty osteoarthritis patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis between 50 and 80 years of age participated in the pilot study. After 12 weeks this difference disappeared (p=0.5). Overall, users were enthusiastic about Join2move. In particular, performing exercise at one's own pace without time or travel restrictions was cited as convenient. However, some minor flaws were observed. Users perceived some difficulties in completing the entire introduction module and rated the inability to edit and undo actions as annoying.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This paper outlines the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a web-based physical activity intervention. Preliminary results from the pilot study revealed that physical activity scores increased, although differences were not statistically significant. Interviews and usability tests suggest that the intervention is feasible and acceptable in promoting physical activity in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. The intervention was easy to use and the satisfaction with the program was high.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  The Netherlands National Trial Register. Trial number: NTR2483

The aim of this study was to investigate the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of Join2move in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A non-randomized pilot study was performed among patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. Primary outcomes were physical activity (SQUASH Questionnaire), physical function (HOOS and KOOS questionnaires) and self-perceived effect (7-point Likert scale). Baseline, 6 and 12 week follow-up data were collected via online questionnaires. To assess feasibility and acceptability, program usage (modules completed) and user satisfaction (SUS questionnaire) were measured as secondary outcomes. Participants from the pilot study were invited to be interviewed. The interviews focused on users' experiences with Join2move. Besides the pilot study we performed two usability tests to determine the feasibility and acceptability of Join2move. In the first usability test, software experts evaluated the website from a list of usability concepts. In the second test, users were asked to verbalize thoughts during the execution of multiple tasks.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Twenty osteoarthritis patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis between 50 and 80 years of age participated in the pilot study. After six weeks, pain scores increased from 5.3 to 6.6 (p=0.04). Overall, users were enthusiastic about Join2move. In particular, performing exercise at one's own pace without time or travel restrictions was cited as convenient. However, some minor flaws were observed. Users perceived some difficulties in completing the entire introduction module and rated the inability to edit and undo actions as annoying.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This paper outlines the preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a web-based physical activity intervention. Preliminary results from the pilot study revealed that physical activity scores increased, although differences were not statistically significant. Interviews and usability tests suggest that the intervention is feasible and acceptable in promoting physical activity in patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. The intervention was easy to use and the satisfaction with the program was high.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  The Netherlands National Trial Register. Trial number: NTR2483

ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  TITLE: Role of very short-term intravenous hydrocortisone in reducing postdural puncture headache    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  Headache is not an uncommon complication of spinal anesthesia. The efficacy of intravenous (intravenous) hydrocortisone in treating the patients with postdural puncture headache was observed in this study.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Sixty patients with headache following spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups. Thirty patients received only conventional therapy (recumbent positioning, intravenous or oral hydration, analgesics with caffeine, stool softeners, and soft diet) plus 2 ml of normal saline intravenous (placebo) 8 hourly for 48 h. Thirty other patients received conventional therapy plus hydrocortisone intravenous (100 mg in 2 ml 8 hourly for 48 h). Headache intensity was measured using visual analogue scale.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  No significant difference was observed in baseline headache intensity between the two groups (P = 0.6642) before beginning of treatment. After 6 h, the mean headache intensity in patients treated conventionally was 6.02 ± 2.46, while it was 2.06 ± 1.98 in other patients who received additional hydrocortisone intravenous (P < 0.0001). Very short-term use of intravenous hydrocortisone was found effective in reducing headache following spinal anesthesia. However, its clear mechanism of action is yet to be determined. Large-scale studies are recommended to consider the steroid therapy as a standard treatment for postdural puncture headache.

2	3284878	ultrasound guided needle aspiration	The two groups were comparably in demographic characteristic and breast abscess size. TITLE:  Ultrasound Guided Needle Aspiration versus Surgical Drainage in the management of breast abscesses: a Ugandan experience    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Despite breast abscess becoming less common in developed countries, it has remained one of the leading causes of morbidity in women in developing countries. A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Mulago hospital complex in Kampala Uganda to establish whether ultrasound guided needle aspiration is a feasible alternative treatment option for breast abscesses.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A total of 65 females with breast abscess were analyzed, of these 33 patients were randomized into the ultrasound guided needle aspiration and 32 patients in the Incision and drainage arm. The mean age was 23.12, most of them were lactating (66.2%), primipararous (44.6%) with peripheral abscesses (73.8%) located in the upper lateral quadrant (56%).The mean breast size was 3.49 cm. Survival analysis showed no difference in breast abscess healing rate between the two groups (Log rank 0.24 df 1 and P = 0.63). Incision and drainage was found to be more costly than ultrasound guided aspiration (cost effective ratio of 2.85).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Ultrasound guided needle aspiration is therefore a feasible and cost effective treatment option for both lactating and non lactating breast abscesses with a diameter up to 5 cm by ultrasound in an immune competent patient

TITLE: Pharmacokinetics and Acid Suppressant Efficacy of Esomeprazole after Intravenous, Oral, and Subcutaneous Administration to Healthy Beagle Dogs    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Esomeprazole is an S‐enantiomer of omeprazole that has favorable pharmacokinetics and efficacious acid suppressant properties in humans. However, the pharmacokinetics and effects on intragastric pH of esomeprazole in dogs have not been reported.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To determine the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole administered via various routes (PK study) and to investigate the effect of esomeprazole on intragastric pH with a Bravo pH monitoring system (PD study).   ABSTRACT.ANIMALS.  Seven adult male Beagle dogs and 5 adult male Beagle dogs were used for PK and PD study, respectively.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Both studies used an open, randomized, and crossover design. In the PK study, 7 dogs received intravenous (intravenous), subcutaneous (subcutaneous), and oral doses (PO) of esomeprazole (1 mg/kg). Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. Esomeprazole plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC/MS/MS. In the efficacy study, intragastric pH was recorded without medication (baseline pH) and following intravenous, subcutaneous, and PO esomeprazole dosing regimens (1 mg/kg) in 5 dogs.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The bioavailability of esomeprazole administered as PO enteric‐coated granules and as subcutaneous injections was 71.4 and 106%, respectively. The half‐life was approximately 1 hour. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The PK parameters for PO and subcutaneous esomeprazole administration were favorable, and esomeprazole significantly increased intragastric pH after intravenous, PO, and subcutaneous administration. intravenous and subcutaneous administration of esomeprazole might be useful when PO administration is not possible. No significant adverse effects were observed.

TITLE: Pharmacokinetics and Acid Suppressant Efficacy of Esomeprazole after Intravenous, Oral, and Subcutaneous Administration to Healthy Beagle Dogs    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Esomeprazole is an S‐enantiomer of omeprazole that has favorable pharmacokinetics and efficacious acid suppressant properties in humans. However, the pharmacokinetics and effects on intragastric pH of esomeprazole in dogs have not been reported.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To determine the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole administered via various routes (PK study) and to investigate the effect of esomeprazole on intragastric pH with a Bravo pH monitoring system (PD study).   ABSTRACT.ANIMALS.  Seven adult male Beagle dogs and 5 adult male Beagle dogs were used for PK and PD study, respectively.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Both studies used an open, randomized, and crossover design. In the PK study, 7 dogs received intravenous (intravenous), subcutaneous (subcutaneous), and oral doses (PO) of esomeprazole (1 mg/kg). Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 10 days. Esomeprazole plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC/MS/MS. In the efficacy study, intragastric pH was recorded without medication (baseline pH) and following intravenous, subcutaneous, and PO esomeprazole dosing regimens (1 mg/kg) in 5 dogs.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The bioavailability of esomeprazole administered as PO enteric‐coated granules and as subcutaneous injections was 71.4 and 106%, respectively. The half‐life was approximately 1 hour. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The PK parameters for PO and subcutaneous esomeprazole administration were favorable, and esomeprazole significantly increased intragastric pH after intravenous, PO, and subcutaneous administration. intravenous and subcutaneous administration of esomeprazole might be useful when PO administration is not possible. No significant adverse effects were observed.

2	3688436	donepezil in addition to lithium	The total Young Mania Rating Scale difference on the first day approached the conventional significance level (1.97 units, t = 1.84, P = 0.07). TITLE: A randomized, 4-week double-blind placebo control study on the efficacy of donepezil augmentation of lithium for treatment of acute mania    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  A significant number of mania patients fail to respond to current pharmacotherapy, thereby there is need for novel augmentation strategies. The results of some early studies showed the effectiveness of cholinomimetics in the treatment of mania. One open case series suggested the efficacy of donepezil in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Our aim was to explore whether an oral cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, administered during a 4-week treatment period, would benefit patients with acute mania.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  We conducted a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil as an adjunctive treatment to lithium in patients with acute mania. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive donepezil or placebo in addition to lithium. Donepezil was started at 5 mg/day, and increased to 10 mg/day in the first week. Patients were rated with the Young Mania Rating Scale (Young Mania Rating Scale) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) at baseline, day 1, week 1, week 2, and week 4.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Out of the 30 patients who were enrolled, 15 were on donepezil and 15 were on placebo. All patients completed the 4-week trial. On the first day, there was a difference of 1.97 units on the psychomotor symptoms scale of the Young Mania Rating Scale in the donepezil group as compared to the placebo group (t = 2.39, P = 0.02). There was a difference of 0.57 units (t = 2.09, P = 0.04) in the speech item and a difference of 0.29 units in the sexual interest item (t = 2.11, P = 0.04) in the donepezil group as compared to the placebo group. Over the course of 4 weeks, we failed to find that donepezil produced any significant difference in the Young Mania Rating Scale (6.71 units difference, t = −1.44, P = 0.16) or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scale (1.29 units difference, t = −0.33, P = 0.75) as compared to placebo. Ten subjects (66.67%) in both groups met the criteria for clinical response (Fisher's exact P = 1.00). Five subjects (33.33%) in the donepezil group met the criteria for clinical remission while nine subjects (60.00%) in the placebo group met the remission criteria (Fisher's exact P = 0.27).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Use of the oral anticholinergic donepezil had some benefit in the augmentation of lithium treatment on the first day, but did not provide any significant benefits in the long-term.

TITLE: Meditation awareness training for the treatment of workaholism: A controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND AND AIMS.  Workaholism is a form of behavioral addiction that can lead to reduced life and job satisfaction, anxiety, depression, burnout, work–family conflict, and impaired productivity. Given the number of people affected, there is a need for more targeted workaholism treatments. Findings from previous case studies successfully utilizing second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (second-generation mindfulness-based interventions) for treating behavioral addiction suggest that second-generation mindfulness-based interventions may be suitable for treating workaholism. This study conducted a controlled trial to investigate the effects of an SG-MBI known as meditation awareness training (meditation awareness training) on workaholism.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Male and female adults suffering from workaholism (n = 73) were allocated to meditation awareness training or a waiting-list control group. Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up phases.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  meditation awareness training participants demonstrated significant and sustained improvements over control-group participants in workaholism symptomatology, job satisfaction, work engagement, work duration, and psychological distress. ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS.  meditation awareness training may be a suitable intervention for treating workaholism.

2	5307611	Theory-based educational intervention	However, significant differences were found between the scores of all the variables, as well as skin cancer preventive behaviors, in the two groups after the intervention (p<0.05).     TITLE: Skin cancer preventive behaviors among rural farmers: An intervention based on protection motivation theory    ABSTRACT.   Background: Skin cancer is a serious public health problem in the world. Its prevalence in many countries has been increased in recent years. This study aimed to assess the effects of a theory-based educational intervention to promote skin cancer preventive behaviors (skin cancer preventive behaviors) among rural farmers in Chalderan County, Iran.     Methods: This was a quasi-randomized controlled field trial study conducted on 238 rural farmers. The data were collected by a questionnaire containing the constructs of the Protection Motivation Theory (Protection Motivation Theory) as well as the items of skin cancer preventive behaviors. The differences between the groups before and 3 months after the intervention were determined by independent t-test, paired t-test, and chi-square applying SPSS software.     Results: Before the intervention, no significant difference was found in the scores of the Protection Motivation Theory constructs between the two groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: The Protection Motivation Theory was found to be an appropriate framework for designing educational interventions aiming at promoting skin cancer preventive behaviors among rural farmers. It was concluded that designing an educational program with a focus on promoting perceived susceptibility increased the level of performing skin cancer preventive behaviors among the rural farmers.

Results: Before the intervention, no significant difference was found in the scores of the Protection Motivation Theory constructs between the two groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: The Protection Motivation Theory was found to be an appropriate framework for designing educational interventions aiming at promoting skin cancer preventive behaviors among rural farmers. It was concluded that designing an educational program with a focus on promoting perceived susceptibility increased the level of performing skin cancer preventive behaviors among the rural farmers.

TITLE: Skin cancer preventive behaviors among rural farmers: An intervention based on protection motivation theory    ABSTRACT.   Background: Skin cancer is a serious public health problem in the world. Its prevalence in many countries has been increased in recent years. This study aimed to assess the effects of a theory-based educational intervention to promote skin cancer preventive behaviors (skin cancer preventive behaviors) among rural farmers in Chalderan County, Iran.     Methods: This was a quasi-randomized controlled field trial study conducted on 238 rural farmers. The data were collected by a questionnaire containing the constructs of the Protection Motivation Theory (Protection Motivation Theory) as well as the items of skin cancer preventive behaviors. The differences between the groups before and 3 months after the intervention were determined by independent t-test, paired t-test, and chi-square applying SPSS software.     Results: Before the intervention, no significant difference was found in the scores of the Protection Motivation Theory constructs between the two groups (p>0.05).

TITLE: Effect of Propolis Extract in Combination with Eugenol-Free Dressing (Coe-PakTM) on Pain and Wound Healing after Crown-Lengthening: A Randomized Clinical Trial     ABSTRACT.STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:.  Researchers have long been in search of products to enhance healing and patient comfort postoperatively.     ABSTRACT.PURPOSE:.  This study aimed to assess the efficacy of propolis extract in combination with Coe-PakTM dressing for pain relief and wound healing after crown lengthening surgery.    ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHOD: .  This randomized clinical trial was performed on 36 patients who were randomly divided into two groups of Coe-PakTM dressing with (trial group) and without (control group) propolis extract. Pain and burning sensation by use of visual analog scale (visual analog scale) and number of analgesics taken were asked from patients. Gingival color and consistency, bleeding on probing (bleeding on probing) and presence of infection were studied 7 days after dressing removal.    ABSTRACT.RESULTS: .  Although a large number of patients in the trial group did not have burning sensation, this difference was not significant between the two groups (p> 0.05). In both groups, the majority of patients experienced moderate and mild pain and there was no pain in the trial group after three days.  The two groups were not significantly different in terms of inflammation and healing process (bleeding on probing, gingival consistency and color), after 7 days (p> 0.05).    ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION: .  The study results showed no difference in use of Coe-PakTM dressing with and without propolis extract in terms of postoperative pain and healing process following the crown lengthening surgery.  More studies are required to confirm these results.

2	3227609	Oligosaccharides Prebiotic Formula	There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two formula groups.   TITLE: Tolerance and Safety Evaluation in a Large Cohort of Healthy Infants Fed an Innovative Prebiotic Formula: A Randomized Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  the addition of oligosaccharides to infant formula has been shown to mimic some of the beneficial effects of human milk. The aim of the study was to assess the tolerance and safety of a formula containing an innovative mixture of oligosaccharides in early infancy.   ABSTRACT.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS.  this study was performed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including healthy term infants. Infants were recruited before the age of 8 weeks, either having started with formula feeding or being fully breast-fed (breastfeeding group). Formula-fed infants were randomized to feeding with a regular formula containing a mixture of neutral oligosaccharides and pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (prebiotic formula group) or regular formula without oligosaccharides (control formula group). Growth, tolerance and adverse events were assessed at 8, 16, 24 and 52 weeks of age. The prebiotic and control groups showed similar mean weight, length and head circumference, skin fold thicknesses, arm circumference gains and stool frequency at each study point. As far as the anthropometric parameters are concerned, the prebiotic group and the control group did not attain the values shown by the breastfeeding group at any study point. The skin fold thicknesses assessed in the breastfeeding group at 8 weeks were strikingly larger than those in formula fed infants, whereas at 52 weeks were strikingly smaller. The stool consistency in the prebiotic group was softer than in the control group at 8, 16 and 24 weeks (p<0.001) and closer to that of the breastfeeding group. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS. our findings demonstrate the tolerability and the long term safety of a formula containing an innovative mixture of oligosaccharides in a large cohort of healthy infants.

TITLE: Effects of interventions on trajectories of health-related quality of life among older patients with hip fracture: a prospective randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Health-related quality of life (Health-related quality of life) has been used to assess subjects' prognosis and recovery following hip fracture. However, evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve Health-related quality of life of elders with hip fracture. The purposes of this study were to identify distinct Health-related quality of life trajectories and to evaluate the effects of two care models on these trajectories over 12 months following hip-fracture surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  For this secondary analysis, data came from a randomized controlled trial of subjects with hip fracture receiving three treatment care models: interdisciplinary care (n = 97), comprehensive care (n = 91), and usual care (n = 93). Interdisciplinary care consisted of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4 months of in-home rehabilitation. Comprehensive care consisted of interdisciplinary care plus management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms, fall prevention, and 12 months of in-home rehabilitation. Usual care included only in-hospital rehabilitation and occasional discharge planning, without geriatric consultation and in-home rehabilitation. Mental and physical Health-related quality of life were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge by the physical component summary scale (physical component summary scale) and mental component summary scale (mental component summary scale), respectively, of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Taiwan version. Latent class growth modeling was used to identify physical component summary scale and mental component summary scale trajectories and to evaluate how they were affected by the interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  We identified three quadratic physical component summary scale trajectories: poor physical component summary scale (n = 103, 36.6 %), moderate physical component summary scale (n = 96, 34.2 %), and good physical component summary scale (n = 82, 29.2 %). In contrast, we found three linear mental component summary scale trajectories: poor mental component summary scale (n = 39, 13.9 %), moderate mental component summary scale (n = 84, 29.9 %), and good mental component summary scale (n = 158, 56.2 %). However, neither care model improved mental component summary scale.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models improved recovery from hip fracture by increasing subjects' odds for following a trajectory of good physical functioning after hospitalization.

TITLE: Effects of interventions on trajectories of health-related quality of life among older patients with hip fracture: a prospective randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Health-related quality of life (Health-related quality of life) has been used to assess subjects' prognosis and recovery following hip fracture. However, evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve Health-related quality of life of elders with hip fracture. The purposes of this study were to identify distinct Health-related quality of life trajectories and to evaluate the effects of two care models on these trajectories over 12 months following hip-fracture surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  For this secondary analysis, data came from a randomized controlled trial of subjects with hip fracture receiving three treatment care models: interdisciplinary care (n = 97), comprehensive care (n = 91), and usual care (n = 93). Interdisciplinary care consisted of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4 months of in-home rehabilitation. Comprehensive care consisted of interdisciplinary care plus management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms, fall prevention, and 12 months of in-home rehabilitation. Usual care included only in-hospital rehabilitation and occasional discharge planning, without geriatric consultation and in-home rehabilitation. Mental and physical Health-related quality of life were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge by the physical component summary scale (physical component summary scale) and mental component summary scale (mental component summary scale), respectively, of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Taiwan version. Latent class growth modeling was used to identify physical component summary scale and mental component summary scale trajectories and to evaluate how they were affected by the interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  We identified three quadratic physical component summary scale trajectories: poor physical component summary scale (n = 103, 36.6 %), moderate physical component summary scale (n = 96, 34.2 %), and good physical component summary scale (n = 82, 29.2 %).

TITLE: Influence of Craniosacral Therapy on Anxiety, Depression and Quality of Life in Patients with Fibromyalgia    ABSTRACT.  Fibromyalgia is considered as a combination of physical, psychological and social disabilities. The causes of pathologic mechanism underlying fibromyalgia are unknown, but fibromyalgia may lead to reduced quality of life. The objective of this study was to analyze the repercussions of craniosacral therapy on depression, anxiety and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients with painful symptoms. An experimental, double-blind longitudinal clinical trial design was undertaken. Eighty-four patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to an intervention group (craniosacral therapy) or placebo group (simulated treatment with disconnected ultrasound). The treatment period was 25 weeks. Anxiety, pain, sleep quality, depression and quality of life were determined at baseline and at 10 minutes, 6 months and 1-year post-treatment. However, at the 1-year follow-up, the groups only differed in the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Approaching fibromyalgia by means of craniosacral therapy contributes to improving anxiety and quality of life levels in these patients.

TITLE: Efficacy of alfacalcidol and alendronate on lumbar bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients using proton pump inhibitors    ABSTRACT.  It has been indicated that proton pump inhibitor (proton pump inhibitor) use is associated with a loss of the anti-fracture efficacy of alendronate (alendronate). However, there are few prospective studies that have investigated the efficacy of alendronate on lumbar bone mineral density (bone mineral density) in osteoporotic patients who are using proton pump inhibitors. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of alfacalcidol (alfacalcidol) and alendronate on lumbar bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients using proton pump inhibitors. A prospective, randomized, active control study enrolled such osteoporotic patients (age, ≥50 years). The patients were randomly assigned to receive alfacalcidol (1 μg/day) or alendronate (35 mg/week) and were followed up for one year. Patient profiles were maintained, and lumbar bone mineral density, bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase (bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase) and collagen type-I cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTX), upper gastrointestinal endoscopy results, and the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (FSSG) were evaluated. Percentage changes in lumbar bone mineral density, NTX, bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase, and change in FSSG score from baseline to the end of one year of treatment were investigated. Sixteen patients were eligible for analysis (eight assigned to receive alfacalcidol, eight assigned to receive alendronate). No significant percentage change of bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase and NTX between the two groups was observed. Subsequent to one year of treatment, the FSSG score did not change from the baseline values for either study group, and no new bone fractures or esophagitis were observed in either group of patients. The findings demonstrated that in osteoporotic patients using concomitant proton pump inhibitors, there was a greater increase in lumbar bone mineral density after one year of treatment with alendronate compared with alfacalcidol. However, the number of study subjects was small; thus, further, large prospective studies are required to determine the effect of alendronate in osteoporotic patients using concomitant proton pump inhibitors.

However, there are few prospective studies that have investigated the efficacy of alendronate on lumbar bone mineral density (bone mineral density) in osteoporotic patients who are using proton pump inhibitors. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of alfacalcidol (alfacalcidol) and alendronate on lumbar bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients using proton pump inhibitors. A prospective, randomized, active control study enrolled such osteoporotic patients (age, ≥50 years). The patients were randomly assigned to receive alfacalcidol (1 μg/day) or alendronate (35 mg/week) and were followed up for one year. Patient profiles were maintained, and lumbar bone mineral density, bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase (bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase) and collagen type-I cross-linked N-telopeptide (NTX), upper gastrointestinal endoscopy results, and the frequency scale for the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (FSSG) were evaluated. Percentage changes in lumbar bone mineral density, NTX, bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase, and change in FSSG score from baseline to the end of one year of treatment were investigated. Sixteen patients were eligible for analysis (eight assigned to receive alfacalcidol, eight assigned to receive alendronate). No significant percentage change of bone-specific alkaline-phosphatase and NTX between the two groups was observed. Subsequent to one year of treatment, the FSSG score did not change from the baseline values for either study group, and no new bone fractures or esophagitis were observed in either group of patients. The findings demonstrated that in osteoporotic patients using concomitant proton pump inhibitors, there was a greater increase in lumbar bone mineral density after one year of treatment with alendronate compared with alfacalcidol. However, the number of study subjects was small; thus, further, large prospective studies are required to determine the effect of alendronate in osteoporotic patients using concomitant proton pump inhibitors.

The percentage change in lumbar bone mineral density from baseline to the end of treatment was −0.4±4.0% for the alfacalcidol group vs. 6.8±6.3% for the alendronate group (P=0.015).

2	5627563	Atracurium	Jaw relaxation and ease of laryngeal mask airway insertion in the study group was significantly better than that of the control group (P = 0.02). TITLE: Effect of Low-dose Atracurium on Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion Conditions: A Randomized Double-blind Clinical Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  The amount of sedation and muscle relaxation of the jaw may have an impact on complications caused by laryngeal mask airway (laryngeal mask airway). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-dose Atracurium on conditions of insertion, complications, and hemodynamic responses to laryngeal mask airway insertion following induction of anesthesia with propofol, in patients undergoing cataract surgery.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS:.  In this double-blind randomized clinical trial study, 60 patients were randomly divided into two groups. Initially, the patients in the study group received 0.15 mg/kg intravenous injection of atracurium, and the patients in the control group received 2 ml of intravenous injection of normal saline, after which anesthesia in both groups were induced with midazolam, fentanyl, lidocaine, and propofol. The amount of jaw relaxation, ease of insertion, and the time needed for insertion, hemodynamic responses and complications of laryngeal mask airway insertion were evaluated.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Average time needed for laryngeal mask airway placement in the study group (5/06 ± 0.52 second) was significantly lower than the control group (5/76 ± 0.67 second) (P = 0.001). Hemodynamic response to laryngeal mask airway insertion was similar in both groups. Sore throat at recovery and 24 h after surgery in the control group was significantly higher than that of the study group (3/30 vs. 10/30) (P = 0.01).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Using low doses of atracurium decreases the time needed for laryngeal mask airway insertion and sore throat after the operation. Atracurium also increases jaw relaxation and facilitates the placement of laryngeal mask airway.

TITLE: The Effect of Vascular Risk Factors on the Efficacy of Rivastigmine Patch and Capsule Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Vascular risk factors (Vascular risk factors) may influence response to rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Alzheimer's disease patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine patch and capsule treatment were stratified by baseline Vascular risk factors status. Treatment response was evaluated using the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (AD Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change) and the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living) scale.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores significantly improved in all rivastigmine-treated patients (p < 0.05 vs. placebo), except 9.5 mg/24 h patch-treated patients with Vascular risk factors, and were significantly affected by Vascular risk factors status in the study population as a whole. The AD Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change significantly improved in capsule-treated patients with, and patch-treated patients without Vascular risk factors. Although non-significant, patients without Vascular risk factors showed an apparent faster rate of placebo decline.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Vascular risk factors may influence Alzheimer's disease progression and response to rivastigmine.

Vascular risk factors (Vascular risk factors) may influence response to rivastigmine in Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Alzheimer's disease patients who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of rivastigmine patch and capsule treatment were stratified by baseline Vascular risk factors status. Treatment response was evaluated using the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (AD Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change) and the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living) scale.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores significantly improved in all rivastigmine-treated patients (p < 0.05 vs. placebo), except 9.5 mg/24 h patch-treated patients with Vascular risk factors, and were significantly affected by Vascular risk factors status in the study population as a whole. The AD Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change significantly improved in capsule-treated patients with, and patch-treated patients without Vascular risk factors. Although non-significant, patients without Vascular risk factors showed an apparent faster rate of placebo decline.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Vascular risk factors may influence Alzheimer's disease progression and response to rivastigmine.

TITLE: Antibiotic Prophylaxis Using Third Generation Cephalosporins Can Reduce the Risk of Early Rebleeding in the First Acute Gastroesophageal Variceal Hemorrhage: A Prospective Randomized Study    ABSTRACT.  Bacterial infection may be a critical trigger for variceal bleeding. Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent rebleeding in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (gastroesophageal variceal bleeding). The aim of the study was to compare prophylactic third generation cephalosporins with on-demand antibiotics for the prevention of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding. In a prospective trial, patients with the first acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic antibiotics (intravenous cefotaxime 2 g q 8 hr for 7 days, prophylactic antibiotics group) or to receive the same antibiotics only when infection became evident (on-demand group). Sixty-two patients in the prophylactic group and 58 patients in the on-demand group were included for analysis. Antibiotic prophylaxis decreased infection (3.2% vs. 15.5%, p=0.026). The difference of rebleeding rate was mostly due to early rebleeding within 6 weeks (4.8% vs. 20.7%, p=0.012). On multivariate analysis, antibiotic prophylaxis (relative hazard: 0.248, 95% confidence interval (confidence interval): 0.067-0.919, p=0.037) and bacterial infection (relative hazard: 3.901, 95% confidence interval: 1.053-14.448, p=0.042) were two independent determinants of early rebleeding. In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis using third generation cephalosporins can prevent bacterial infection and early rebleeding in patients with the first acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

TITLE: Pioglitazone Decreases Hepatitis C Viral Load in Overweight, Treatment Naïve, Genotype 4 Infected-Patients: A Pilot Study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Insulin resistance (Insulin resistance) is induced by chronic hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C virus) genotypes 1 and 4 infections. It is not known whether drugs that affect Insulin resistance such as Pioglitazone and Prednisone also affect serum hepatitis C virus RNA titers independently of PEG-Interferon-α2/ribavirin treatment. The primary aim was to assess whether Pioglitazone by improving Insulin resistance and/or inflammation decreases hepatitis C virus viral load independently of standard of care hepatitis C virus treatment. A secondary aim was to assess whether Prednisone, a drug that induces insulin resistance and stimulates hepatitis C virus viral entry and replication in replicon culture systems, increases hepatitis C virus viral load in this population.   ABSTRACT.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS.  We designed a two-arm, parallel Pilot Study of overweight, treatment naïve genotype 4 HCV-infected patients at a public referral Liver Clinic in Giza, Egypt. The subjects received Pioglitazone (30 mg/day for 14 days) or Prednisone (40 mg/day for 4 days) in a randomized fashion, but the two arms can be considered independent pilot studies. Only changes from baseline within each arm were assessed and no contrasts of the interventions were made, as this was not an aim of the study. Among 105 consecutive hepatitis C virus genotype 4 patients, 39 were enrolled based on the optimal sample size and power analysis according to the CONSORT statement; 20 to the Pioglitazone group and 19 to the Prednisone group. Although Prednisone did increase serum hepatitis C virus RNA at day-4 (n = 10; change from baseline = −42,786 IU/ml; 95% CI −85,500 to −15,700; P = 0.049), the log10 hepatitis C virus RNA titers were statistically not different from baseline day-0.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE.  This is the first documentation that Pioglitazone decreases the serum hepatitis C virus RNA titers independently of PEG-Interferon-α2/ribavirin treatment. The novel findings of our Study provide the foundation for basic and clinical investigations on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the Pioglitazone-induced decrease in hepatitis C virus genotype 4 RNA titers.

2	4517027	Pre-exercise breakfast	Breakfast was also beneficial for appetite control before lunch irrespective of size (all p < 0.05, d > 0.43). TITLE: The Effect of Breakfast Prior to Morning Exercise on Cognitive Performance, Mood and Appetite Later in the Day in Habitually Active Women    ABSTRACT.  Pre-exercise nutritional practices for active females exercising for mood, cognitive and appetite benefits are not well established. Results from an initial field pilot study showed that higher energy intake at breakfast was associated with lower fatigue and higher overall mood and alertness post-exercise (all p < 0.05). In a follow-up, randomised, controlled trial, 24 active women completed three trials in a balanced, cross-over design. At 0815 h participants completed baseline cognitive tasks, mood and appetite visual analogue scales (visual analogue scales) and were administered a cereal breakfast (providing 118 or 236 kcal) or no breakfast. After 45 min, they completed a 30 min run at 65% heart rate reserve (heart rate reserve). Parameters were re-assessed immediately after exercise, then hourly until lunch (~1240 h), immediately post-lunch and at 1500 and 1900 h via a mobile phone. Breakfast enhanced feelings of relaxation before lunch (p < 0.05, d > 0.40), though breakfast was detrimental for working memory mid-afternoon (p = 0.019, d = 0.37) and mental fatigue and tension later in the day (all p < 0.05, d > 0.038). These data provide information on pre-exercise nutritional practices for active females and suggest that a small breakfast eaten prior to exercise can benefit post-exercise mood and subjective appetite ratings.

2	5564145	Double cartridges of 4% articaine	The DC of 4 % articaine had a significantly higher success rate (83.3%) than did the SC (53.3%; P < 0.05). TITLE: Double versus single cartridge of 4% articaine infiltration into the retro-molar area for lower third molar surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  There are no studies regarding 4% articaine infiltration injection into the retro-molar area for an impacted lower third molar (LITM) surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of infiltration using 1.7 ml (single cartridge: SC) of 4% articaine versus 3.4 ml (double cartridges: DC) of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in LITM surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  This study involved 30 healthy patients with symmetrical LITM. The patients were assigned to receive either a DC or SC of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic for each operation. Onset, duration, profoundness, need for additional anesthetic administration, total volume of anesthetic used, vitality of the tooth, and pain score during operation were recorded.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The duration of soft tissue anesthesia was longer in the DC group. The intra-operative pain was higher in the SC group with a significant (P < 0.05) requirement for a supplementary local anesthetic.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  We concluded that using DC for the infiltration injection had a higher success rate, longer duration of anesthesia, less intra-operative pain, and a lower amount of additional anesthesia than SC in the surgical removal of LITM. We recommend that a DC of 4% articaine and a 1:100,000 epinephrine infiltration in the retro-molar region can be an alternative anesthetic for LITM surgery.

TITLE: Double versus single cartridge of 4% articaine infiltration into the retro-molar area for lower third molar surgery    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  There are no studies regarding 4% articaine infiltration injection into the retro-molar area for an impacted lower third molar (LITM) surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of infiltration using 1.7 ml (single cartridge: SC) of 4% articaine versus 3.4 ml (double cartridges: DC) of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in LITM surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  This study involved 30 healthy patients with symmetrical LITM. The patients were assigned to receive either a DC or SC of 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as a local anesthetic for each operation. Onset, duration, profoundness, need for additional anesthetic administration, total volume of anesthetic used, vitality of the tooth, and pain score during operation were recorded.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The DC of 4 % articaine had a significantly higher success rate (83.3%) than did the SC (53.3%; P < 0.05). The duration of soft tissue anesthesia was longer in the DC group. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  We concluded that using DC for the infiltration injection had a higher success rate, longer duration of anesthesia, less intra-operative pain, and a lower amount of additional anesthesia than SC in the surgical removal of LITM.

2	1489930	culturally appropriate educational intervention programme for South Asians with Type 2 diabetes	The intervention group showed significant improvements in scores for Knowledge (+12.5%); Attitudes toward seriousness (+13.5%), complications (+8.1%), Practice (+20.0%). TITLE: A controlled trial of the effectiveness of a diabetes education programme in a multi-ethnic community in Glasgow [ISRCT28317455]    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Epidemiologic data have shown that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes varies with ethnic origin. Type 2 diabetes is up to four times more common in British South Asians than in the indigenous white population. The aim of this study was to develop a culturally appropriate educational intervention programme for South Asians with Type 2 diabetes. We then investigated whether this intervention could produce an improvement, and finally whether any improvement was greater than background changes in knowledge in comparison groups.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A multi-site prospective, randomised controlled study was conducted in all day care centres and three general practice registers with high proportion patients from different ethnic minority groups in Glasgow, Scotland. The intervention consisted of 18 educational sessions in 6 separate programmes. A modified questionnaire was used to measure the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of diabetes before and after intervention.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Baseline assessment showed that Indian and Pakistani subjects had less knowledge about diabetes, regarded the disease less seriously, and had a lesser understanding of the relationship between control and complications than the white population. No differences in initial responses were found between those who completed the second assessment and those who did not. However there were also changes in the ethnic control group scores; respectively +5.0%, +16.3% (significant P < 0.001), +1.5%, +1.7%. The single white control group also showed some improvements; respectively +12.2%, +12.4% (P = 0.04), +6.0%, +25.0% (P = 0.007), but the differences in improvement between these two control groups were not significant. Overall, the improvement seen was similar in both intervention and ethnic control groups and there was no significant difference in the amount of change (P = 0.36 CI -0.9 to +2.6).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study has shown that conducting a culturally-competent educational intervention in patients with Type 2 diabetes from ethnic minority groups is feasible and can improve their knowledge and attitudes and practice. However there was no net benefit compared with the control group.

The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness at 1-year follow-up of a manualised group-based programme ('FACETS') for managing MS-fatigue.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  One-year follow-up of a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial. People with multiple sclerosis and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS plus current local practice (FACETS) or current local practice alone (current local practice alone), using concealed computer-generated randomisation. Participant blinding was not possible. Primary outcome measures were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue Severity subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy (MS-Fatigue Self-Efficacy) and disease-specific quality of life (multiple sclerosis Impact Scale).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Between May 2008 and November 2009, 164 participants were randomised. Primary outcome data were available at 1 year for 131 (80%). The benefits demonstrated at 4-months in the FACETS arm for fatigue severity and self-efficacy largely persisted, with a slight reduction in standardised effect sizes (standardised effect sizes) (−0.29, p = 0.06 and 0.34, p = 0.09, respectively). There was a significant difference on the multiple sclerosis Impact Scale favouring FACETS that had not been present at 4-months (standardised effect sizes −0.24, p = 0.046). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Improvements in fatigue severity and self-efficacy at 4-months follow-up following attendance of FACETS were mostly sustained at 1 year with additional improvements in multiple sclerosis impact. The FACETS programme provides modest long-term benefits to people with MS-fatigue.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  ISRCTN76517470
2	4682450	Naproxen sodium + diphenhydramine (440mg/25mg)	In the second study, the naproxen sodium 440 mg/DPH 25 mg combination failed to show any significant improvements vs. either component alone.   TITLE: Efficacy and tolerability studies evaluating a sleep aid and analgesic combination of naproxen sodium and diphenhydramine in the dental impaction pain model in subjects with induced transient insomnia    ABSTRACT.STUDY OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of novel combination naproxen sodium (naproxen sodium) and diphenhydramine (diphenhydramine) in subjects with postoperative dental pain along with transient insomnia induced by 5 h sleep phase advance. The present studies aimed to demonstrate the added benefit and optimal dosages of the combination product over individual ingredients alone in improving sleep and pain.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Each of the two studies was a two-centre, randomised, double-blind and double-dummy trial. In the first study, subjects were randomised into one of the following treatment arms: naproxen sodium 440 mg/DPH 50 mg, naproxen sodium 220 mg/DPH 50 mg, naproxen sodium 440 mg or diphenhydramine 50 mg. In the second study, subjects received either naproxen sodium 440 mg/DPH 25 mg, naproxen sodium 440 mg or diphenhydramine 50 mg. The co-primary end-points in both studies were wake time after sleep onset (wake time after sleep onset) and sleep latency (sleep latency) measured by actigraphy. Other secondary sleep and pain end-points were also assessed.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The intent-to-treat population included 712 and 267 subjects from studies one and two, respectively. In the first study, only the naproxen sodium 440 mg/DPH 50 mg combination showed significant improvements in both wake time after sleep onset vs. naproxen sodium alone (−70.3 min p = 0.0002) and sleep latency vs. diphenhydramine alone (25.50 and 41.50 min respectively, p < 0.0001). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Only the naproxen sodium 440 mg/DPH 50 mg combination demonstrated improvement in both sleep latency vs. diphenhydramine 50 mg and sleep maintenance (wake time after sleep onset) vs. naproxen sodium 440 mg. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events reported in either study. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT01280591 (study 1); NCT01495858 (study 2)

TITLE: Memorizing fruit: The effect of a fruit memory-game on children's fruit intake    ABSTRACT.  Food cues of palatable food are omnipresent, thereby simulating the intake of unhealthy snack food among children. As a consequence, this might lead to a higher intake of energy-dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables, a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children. We used a randomized between-subject design with 127 children (age: 7–12 y) who played a memory-game, containing either fruit (n = 64) or non-food products (n = 63). While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. The main finding is that playing a memory-game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016). The findings suggest that playing a memory-game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children. This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit, according to international standards, and more traditional health interventions have limited success. Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults, making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way.

While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. The main finding is that playing a memory-game containing fruit increases overall fruit intake (P = 0.016). The findings suggest that playing a memory-game with fruit stimulates fruit intake among young children. This is an important finding because children eat insufficient fruit, according to international standards, and more traditional health interventions have limited success. Healthy eating habits of children maintain when they become adults, making it important to stimulate fruit intake among children in an enjoyable way.

TITLE: Memorizing fruit: The effect of a fruit memory-game on children's fruit intake    ABSTRACT.  Food cues of palatable food are omnipresent, thereby simulating the intake of unhealthy snack food among children. As a consequence, this might lead to a higher intake of energy-dense snacks and less fruit and vegetables, a habit that increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. The aim of this experimental study is to examine whether playing a memory game with fruit affects fruit intake among young children. We used a randomized between-subject design with 127 children (age: 7–12 y) who played a memory-game, containing either fruit (n = 64) or non-food products (n = 63). While playing the memory-game in a separate room in school during school hours, free intake of fruit (mandarins, apples, bananas, and grapes) was measured. Afterwards, the children completed self-report measures, and length and weight were assessed. Children who played the fruit version of the memory-game ate more bananas (P = 0.015) and mandarins (P = 0.036) than children who played the non-food memory-game; no effects were found for apples (P > 0.05) and grapes (P > 0.05).

TITLE: Effect of aclidinium bromide on cough and sputum symptoms in moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in three phase III trials    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Cough and sputum are troublesome symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and are associated with adverse outcomes. The efficacy of aclidinium bromide 400 μg twice daily in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been established in two phase III studies (ACCORD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease I and ATTAIN) and a phase IIIb active-comparator study. This analysis evaluated cough-related symptoms across these studies.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  Patients were randomised to placebo, aclidinium 200 μg or 400 μg twice daily in ACCORD (12 weeks) and ATTAIN (24 weeks), or to placebo, aclidinium 400 μg twice daily or tiotropium 18 μg once daily (6-week active-comparator study). Analysed end points included changes from baseline in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms; formerly known as EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool), total and cough/sputum scores and frequency/severity of morning and night-time cough and sputum symptoms.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Data for 1792 patients were evaluated. Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms cough/sputum domain scores were significantly reduced with aclidinium 400 μg versus placebo in ATTAIN (−0.7 vs −0.3, respectively; p<0.01) and the active-comparator study (−0.6 vs −0.2, respectively; p<0.01). In the active-comparator study, significantly greater improvements were observed with aclidinium versus placebo for severity of morning cough (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.01) and phlegm (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.05).

This analysis evaluated cough-related symptoms across these studies.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  Patients were randomised to placebo, aclidinium 200 μg or 400 μg twice daily in ACCORD (12 weeks) and ATTAIN (24 weeks), or to placebo, aclidinium 400 μg twice daily or tiotropium 18 μg once daily (6-week active-comparator study). Analysed end points included changes from baseline in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms; formerly known as EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool), total and cough/sputum scores and frequency/severity of morning and night-time cough and sputum symptoms.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Data for 1792 patients were evaluated. Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms cough/sputum domain scores were significantly reduced with aclidinium 400 μg versus placebo in ATTAIN (−0.7 vs −0.3, respectively; p<0.01) and the active-comparator study (−0.6 vs −0.2, respectively; p<0.01). In the active-comparator study, significantly greater improvements were observed with aclidinium versus placebo for severity of morning cough (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.01) and phlegm (−0.19 vs −0.02; p<0.05). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Aclidinium 400 μg twice daily improves cough and sputum expectoration versus placebo in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS.

2	4976892	DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine	We found that the DNA prime-rAd5 boost vaccine induced a significant cross-clade HIV-specific antibody response, which correlated with antibody neutralization efficiency. TITLE: HIV-1-Specific Antibody Response and Function after DNA Prime and Recombinant Adenovirus 5 Boost HIV Vaccine in HIV-Infected Subjects    ABSTRACT.  Little is known about the humoral immune response against DNA prime-recombinant adenovirus 5 (prime-recombinant adenovirus 5) boost HIV vaccine among HIV-infected patients on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (antiretroviral therapy). Previous studies emphasized cellular immune responses; however, current research suggests both cellular and humoral responses are likely required for a successful therapeutic vaccine. Thus, we aimed to understand antibody response and function induced by vaccination of ART-treated HIV-1-infected patients with immune recovery. All subjects participated in EraMune 02, an open-label randomized clinical trial of antiretroviral therapy intensification followed by a six plasmid DNA prime (envA, envB, envC, gagB, polB, nefB) and prime-recombinant adenovirus 5 boost HIV vaccine with matching inserts. Antibody binding levels were determined with a recently developed microarray approach. We also analyzed neutralization efficiency and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). However, despite the increase in antibody binding levels, the vaccine did not significantly stimulate neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity responses. This finding was also reflected by a lack of change in total CD4+ cell associated HIV DNA in those who received the vaccine. Our results have important implications for further therapeutic vaccine design and administration, especially in HIV-1 infected patients, as boosting of preexisting antibody responses are unlikely to lead to clearance of latent proviruses in the HIV reservoir.

2	5655938	Asian students	Despite this stereotype activation, student ethnicity had no influence on examiners' scores; on the feedback examiners gave; or on examiners' memories for one performance.   TITLE: A randomised trial of the influence of racial stereotype bias on examiners’ scores, feedback and recollections in undergraduate clinical exams    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Asian medical students and doctors receive lower scores on average than their white counterparts in examinations in the UK and internationally (a phenomenon known as "differential attainment"). This could be due to examiner bias or to social, psychological or cultural influences on learning or performance. We investigated whether students' scores or feedback show influence of ethnicity-related bias; whether examiners unconsciously bring to mind (activate) stereotypes when judging Asian students' performance; whether activation depends on the stereotypicality of students' performances; and whether stereotypes influence examiner memories of performances.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This is a randomised, double-blinded, controlled, Internet-based trial. We created near-identical videos of medical student performances on a simulated Objective Structured Clinical Exam using British Asian and white British actors. Examiners were randomly assigned to watch performances from white and Asian students that were either consistent or inconsistent with a previously described stereotype of Asian students' performance. We compared the two examiner groups in terms of the following: the scores and feedback they gave white and Asian students; how much the Asian stereotype was activated in their minds (response times to Asian-stereotypical vs neutral words in a lexical decision task); and whether the stereotype influenced memories of student performances (recognition rates for real vs invented stereotype-consistent vs stereotype-inconsistent phrases from one of the videos).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Examiners responded to Asian-stereotypical words (716 ms, 95% confidence interval (confidence interval) 702–731 ms) faster than neutral words (769 ms, 95% confidence interval 753–786 ms, p < 0.001), suggesting Asian stereotypes were activated (or at least active) in examiners' minds. This occurred regardless of whether examiners observed stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent performances. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Examiner bias does not appear to explain the differential attainment of Asian students in UK medical schools. Efforts to ensure equality should focus on social, psychological and cultural factors that may disadvantage learning or performance in Asian and other minority ethnic students.

TITLE: Preliminary results, methodological considerations and recruitment difficulties of a randomised clinical trial comparing two treatment regimens for patients with headache and neck pain    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Headache is a highly prevalent disorder. Irrespective of the headache diagnosis it is often accompanied with neck pain and -stiffness. Due to this common combination of headache and neck pain, physical treatments of the cervical spine are often considered. The additional value of these treatments to standard medical care or usual care (usual care) is insufficiently documented.   We therefore wanted to compare the treatment effects of usual care alone and in combination with manual therapy (manual therapy) in patients with a combination of headache and neck pain. usual care consisted of a stepped treatment approach according to the Dutch General Practitioners Guideline for headache, the additional manual therapy consisted of articular mobilisations and low load exercises.   Due to insufficient enrolment the study was terminated prematurely. We aim to report not only our preliminary clinical findings but also to discuss the encountered difficulties and to formulate recommendations for future research.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A randomised clinical trial was conducted. Thirty-seven patients were included and randomly allocated to one of both treatment groups. The treatment period was 6 weeks, with follow-up measurements at weeks 7, 12 and 26. Reduction in headache frequency, pain intensity, medication intake, absenteeism and the use of additional professional help were secondary outcome measures  ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Significant improvements on primary and secondary outcome measures were recorded in both treatment groups. No significant differences between both treatment groups were found. The number of recruited patients remained low despite various strategies.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  It appears that both treatment strategies can have equivalent positive influences on headache complaints. Additional studies with larger study populations are needed to draw firm conclusions. Recommendations to increase patient inflow in primary care trials, such as the use of an extended network of participating physicians and of clinical alert software applications, are discussed.

We sought evidence of effectiveness of lay support to improve maternal and child outcomes in disadvantaged families.   ABSTRACT.DESIGN.  Prospective, pragmatic, individually randomised controlled trial.   ABSTRACT.SETTING.  3 Maternity Trusts in West Midlands, UK.   ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS.  Following routine midwife systematic assessment of social risk factors, 1324 nulliparous women were assigned, using telephone randomisation, to standard maternity care, or addition of referral to a Pregnancy Outreach Worker (Pregnancy Outreach Worker) service. Those under 16 years and teenagers recruited to the Family Nurse Partnership trial were excluded.   ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS.  Pregnancy Outreach Workers were trained to provide individual support and case management for the women including home visiting from randomisation to 6 weeks after birth. Standard maternity care (control) included provision for referring women with social risk factors to specialist midwifery services, available to both arms.   ABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.  Primary outcomes were antenatal visits attended and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) 8–12 weeks postpartum. Prespecified, powered, subgroup comparison was among women with 2 or more social risks. Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal birth outcomes; maternal self-efficacy, and mother-to-infant bonding at 8–12 weeks; child development assessment at 6 weeks, breastfeeding at 6 weeks, and immunisation uptake at 4 months, all collected from routine child health systems.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors, mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (MD −0.79 (95% CI −1.56 to −0.02) was significantly better, although for all women recruited, no significant differences were seen (MD −0.59 (95% CI −1.24 to 0.06). Mother-to-infant bonding was significantly better in the intervention group for all women (MD −0.30 (95% CI −0.61 to −0.00) p=0.05), and there were no differences in other secondary outcomes.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This trial demonstrates differences in depressive symptomatology with addition of the Pregnancy Outreach Worker service in the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors. Addition to existing evidence indicates benefit from lay interventions in preventing postnatal depression. This finding is important for women and their families given the known effect of maternal depression on longer term childhood outcomes.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.  ISRCTN35027323; Results.

Pregnancy Outreach Workers were trained to provide individual support and case management for the women including home visiting from randomisation to 6 weeks after birth. Standard maternity care (control) included provision for referring women with social risk factors to specialist midwifery services, available to both arms.   ABSTRACT.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.  Primary outcomes were antenatal visits attended and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) 8–12 weeks postpartum. Prespecified, powered, subgroup comparison was among women with 2 or more social risks. Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal birth outcomes; maternal self-efficacy, and mother-to-infant bonding at 8–12 weeks; child development assessment at 6 weeks, breastfeeding at 6 weeks, and immunisation uptake at 4 months, all collected from routine child health systems.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors, mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (MD −0.79 (95% CI −1.56 to −0.02) was significantly better, although for all women recruited, no significant differences were seen (MD −0.59 (95% CI −1.24 to 0.06). Mother-to-infant bonding was significantly better in the intervention group for all women (MD −0.30 (95% CI −0.61 to −0.00) p=0.05), and there were no differences in other secondary outcomes.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This trial demonstrates differences in depressive symptomatology with addition of the Pregnancy Outreach Worker service in the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors. Addition to existing evidence indicates benefit from lay interventions in preventing postnatal depression. This finding is important for women and their families given the known effect of maternal depression on longer term childhood outcomes.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.  ISRCTN35027323; Results.

TITLE: Capecitabine plus Irinotecan (XELIRI regimen) compared to 5-FU/LV plus Irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with unresectable liver-only metastases of metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomised prospective phase II trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Phase II studies have shown that the combination of capecitabine and irinotecan (the XELIRI regimen) is active in metastatic colorectal cancer (metastatic colorectal cancer). There are, however, no data about the use of the XELIRI regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients with unresectable liver-only metastases of metastatic colorectal cancer with ≤ 75 years of age were randomised to either the XELIRI (irinotecan 250 mg/m2 given on day one and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily from day 2–15, every 21 days) or the FOLFIRI arm (irinotecan 180 mg/m2, 5-FU 400 mg/m2, LV 200 mg/m2, 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 (46-h infusion) – all given on day one, every 14 days). Primary end points were objective response rate (objective response rate) and rate of radical (R0) surgical resection. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (progression-free survival), overall survival (overall survival) and safety.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Altogether 87 patients were enrolled (41 pts in the XELIRI and 46 pts in the FOLFIRI arm). The median age was 63 years (63 years in the XELIRI and 62 years in the FOLFIRI arm) (p = 0.33). objective response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.76). The rate of radical R0 resection was 24% in both arms of patients. At the end of treatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without evidence of the disease (CR+R0 resection) (p = 0.56). There were no statistical differences in grade 3 or 4 adverse events between both arms: diarrhoea 7% vs. 6%, neutropenia 5% vs. 13%, ischemic stroke 0 vs. 2%, acute coronary syndrome 2% vs. 4%, respectively. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The XELIRI regimen showed similar objective response rate as the FOLFIRI regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition, the XELIRI regimen showed similar progression-free survival and overall survival with acceptable toxicity compared to the FOLFIRI regimen.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

Primary end points were objective response rate (objective response rate) and rate of radical (R0) surgical resection. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (progression-free survival), overall survival (overall survival) and safety.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Altogether 87 patients were enrolled (41 pts in the XELIRI and 46 pts in the FOLFIRI arm). The median age was 63 years (63 years in the XELIRI and 62 years in the FOLFIRI arm) (p = 0.33). objective response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.76). The rate of radical R0 resection was 24% in both arms of patients. At the end of treatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without evidence of the disease (CR+R0 resection) (p = 0.56). There were no statistical differences in grade 3 or 4 adverse events between both arms: diarrhoea 7% vs. 6%, neutropenia 5% vs. 13%, ischemic stroke 0 vs. 2%, acute coronary syndrome 2% vs. 4%, respectively. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The XELIRI regimen showed similar objective response rate as the FOLFIRI regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition, the XELIRI regimen showed similar progression-free survival and overall survival with acceptable toxicity compared to the FOLFIRI regimen.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

TITLE: Subfoveal Choroidal Thickness after Panretinal Photocoagulation with Red and Green Laser in Bilateral Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Patients: Short Term Results    ABSTRACT.   Purpose. To compare subfoveal choroidal, central retinal, and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness after panretinal photocoagulation (panretinal photocoagulation) with red and green laser in diabetic patients. Study Design. Randomized clinical trial. Methods. A total of 50 patients with bilateral proliferative diabetic retinopathy and no diabetic macular edema underwent panretinal photocoagulation. One eye was randomly assigned to red or green laser. Subfoveal choroidal, central retinal, and RNFL thicknesses were evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks after treatment. Results. The mean subfoveal choroidal, central retinal, and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness increased significantly in each eye 6 weeks after panretinal photocoagulation (P values in red laser group: <0.01, 0.03, and <0.01, resp., and in green laser group <0.01, <0.01, and <0.01). Conclusion. Both red and green lasers increased mean subfoveal choroidal, central retinal, and peripapillary nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness significantly 6 weeks after panretinal photocoagulation, but there is no difference between these two modalities in this regard.

TITLE: Novel Visual Nasogastric Tube Insertion System: A Feasibility and Efficiency Study in a Manikin    ABSTRACT.   Background. Conventional nasogastric tube placement is an essential clinical procedure; however, complications may arise from blind manipulation. We tested the feasibility and efficiency of a visual nasogastric tube insertion system (visual nasogastric tube insertion system) using a manikin. Methods. A microimaging fiber (0.8 mm) was integrated into the nasogastric tube to create the visual nasogastric tube insertion system. Twenty inexperienced physicians were enrolled and assigned to the visual or conventional group. Each physician performed 10 repeated nasogastric tube insertions with visual guidance or the conventional method; another 20 inexperienced medical students received nasogastric tube insertion training using visual guidance or the conventional method. Results. The nasogastric tube successfully reached the stomach and the narrow anatomic structures were visualized with the visual nasogastric tube insertion system. Time required for insertion was significantly shorter in the visual group compared to the conventional group (22.56 ± 3.08 versus 37.30 ± 4.12 seconds, P < 0.001). Less mucosal damage was noted in the visual group (3.43 ± 1.63 versus 9.86 ± 2.31 cm2). Medical students performed better NGT insertions (shorter insertion time and less procedure-related complications) after undergoing the visual guidance training. Conclusions. The visual nasogastric tube insertion system may provide a new technique for nasogastric tube insertion applicable to clinical use or simulation training.

TITLE: Novel Visual Nasogastric Tube Insertion System: A Feasibility and Efficiency Study in a Manikin    ABSTRACT.   Background. Conventional nasogastric tube placement is an essential clinical procedure; however, complications may arise from blind manipulation. We tested the feasibility and efficiency of a visual nasogastric tube insertion system (visual nasogastric tube insertion system) using a manikin. Methods. A microimaging fiber (0.8 mm) was integrated into the nasogastric tube to create the visual nasogastric tube insertion system. Twenty inexperienced physicians were enrolled and assigned to the visual or conventional group. Each physician performed 10 repeated nasogastric tube insertions with visual guidance or the conventional method; another 20 inexperienced medical students received nasogastric tube insertion training using visual guidance or the conventional method. Results. The nasogastric tube successfully reached the stomach and the narrow anatomic structures were visualized with the visual nasogastric tube insertion system. Tube misplacement was observed in 19/100 cases (19%) in the conventional group; no misplacement was observed in the visual group. Less mucosal damage was noted in the visual group (3.43 ± 1.63 versus 9.86 ± 2.31 cm2). Medical students performed better NGT insertions (shorter insertion time and less procedure-related complications) after undergoing the visual guidance training. Conclusions. The visual nasogastric tube insertion system may provide a new technique for nasogastric tube insertion applicable to clinical use or simulation training.

2	1618957	lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg	Mean (SE) GH levels were lower with lanreotide Autogel® than with lanreotide microparticles (3·8 (0·5) vs 4·3 (0·5) ng/ml; P < 0·001). TITLE: Efficacy of lanreotide Autogel® administered every 4–8 weeks in patients with acromegaly previously responsive to lanreotide microparticles 30 mg: a phase III trial    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN.  Depot somatostatin analogues are well accepted as either adjuvant or primary therapy for acromegaly, and their long dosage intervals facilitate adherence to treatment. Our objective was to evaluate whether lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg, every 4–8 weeks, was as effective in controlling acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, every 1–2 weeks.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS.  Patients who had used lanreotide microparticles 30 mg, ≥ 2 months prestudy, and had responded to treatment were recruited to this open, prospective, multicentre phase III trial. Three to five injections of lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg were administered. Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg was injected every 4, 6 or 8 weeks in patients previously receiving lanreotide microparticles every 7, 10 or 14 days, respectively. GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels were assessed one dosing interval after the final injections.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Ninety-eight patients were enrolled and 93 completed. Steady-state GH concentrations demonstrated similar efficacy between the formulations (upper 95% confidence interval of the quotient, 77·7%). GH levels < 2·5 ng/ml were observed in 54% and 46% of patients; 40% and 35% having GH < 2·5 ng/ml and normalized IGF-1 with lanreotide Autogel® and microparticles, respectively. Symptoms were controlled better with lanreotide Autogel® and treatment was well accepted.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Lanreotide Autogel® 120 mg every 4–8 weeks, is at least as effective and as well tolerated in acromegaly as lanreotide microparticles 30 mg injected every 7–14 days.

TITLE: Alginate Oligosaccharide DP5 Exhibits Antitumor Effects in Osteosarcoma Patients following Surgery    ABSTRACT.  Osteosarcoma is a malignant musculoskeletal tumor that has high-rate morbidity and mortality worldwide. Alginate oligosaccharide (Alginate oligosaccharide), a natural product, has antitumor activities and may have therapeutic effects in osteosarcoma, the molecular mechanisms of which remain unclear. Alginate oligosaccharide was prepared from alginate sodium using alginate lyase. The fractions of Alginate oligosaccharide were further isolated by size-exclusion chromatography and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry). Osteosarcoma patients were enrolled in the study and assigned into two groups: Alginate oligosaccharide (AG, oral administration of 10-mg Alginate oligosaccharide daily) and control groups (control groups, placebo). Preoperative and postoperative clinical data were investigated and analyzed. Four different degrees of polymerizations (degrees of polymerizations) were isolated and denominated as DP2, DP3, DP4, and DP5. Among these polymers, only DP5 showed antitumor functions on osteosarcoma cells. Before surgery and the outcome of primary end point after surgery, no significant differences were observed for clinical data and tumor size between the AG and control groups groups (P > 0.05). The rate of local recurrence was 44.9 and 68.7% in AG and control groups, respectively (P < 0.01). Alginate oligosaccharide treatment resulted in the increase in serum levels of SOD, GSH, HDL-C, and reduction in the levels of interleukin-1 (in the levels of interleukin-1) beta and IL-6; the ratios of AST/ALT; and triglycerides, total cholesterol (total cholesterol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, and malondialdehyde (malondialdehyde) (P < 0.05). Alginate oligosaccharide reduces osteosarcoma progression, which is associated with improvement in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of patients, and may be used as a potential drug for osteosarcoma therapy.

TITLE: Effects of coffee on driving performance during prolonged simulated highway driving    ABSTRACT.RATIONALE.  Coffee is often consumed to counteract driver sleepiness. There is limited information on the effects of a single low dose of coffee on prolonged highway driving in non-sleep deprived individuals.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a single cup of coffee (80 mg caffeine) on simulated highway driving performance.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Non-sleep deprived healthy volunteers (n = 24) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After 2 h of monotonous highway driving, subjects received caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee during a 15-min break before continuing driving for another 2 h. The primary outcome measure was the standard deviation of lateral position (standard deviation of lateral position), reflecting the weaving of the car. Secondary outcome measures were speed variability, subjective sleepiness, and subjective driving performance.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The results showed that caffeinated coffee significantly reduced standard deviation of lateral position as compared to decaffeinated coffee, both in the first (p = 0.024) and second hour (p = 0.019) after the break. Subjective driving quality was significantly improved in the first hour after consuming caffeinated coffee (p = 0.004).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  These findings demonstrate a positive effect of one cup of caffeinated coffee on driving performance and subjective sleepiness during monotonous simulated highway driving.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a single cup of coffee (80 mg caffeine) on simulated highway driving performance.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Non-sleep deprived healthy volunteers (n = 24) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. After 2 h of monotonous highway driving, subjects received caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee during a 15-min break before continuing driving for another 2 h. The primary outcome measure was the standard deviation of lateral position (standard deviation of lateral position), reflecting the weaving of the car. Secondary outcome measures were speed variability, subjective sleepiness, and subjective driving performance.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Similarly, the standard deviation of speed (p = 0.024; p = 0.001), mental effort (p = 0.003; p = 0.023), and subjective sleepiness (p = 0.001; p = 0.002) were reduced in both the first and second hour after consuming caffeinated coffee. Subjective driving quality was significantly improved in the first hour after consuming caffeinated coffee (p = 0.004).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  These findings demonstrate a positive effect of one cup of caffeinated coffee on driving performance and subjective sleepiness during monotonous simulated highway driving.

Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, lower urinary tract symptoms, and quality of life satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three groups. TITLE:      ABSTRACT.  Pain and urinary symptoms following colorectal cancer (colorectal cancer) surgery are frequent and carry a poor recovery. This study tested the effects of inhalation of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (lavender) oil or linalyl acetate on pain relief and lower urinary tract symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms) following the removal of indwelling urinary catheters from patients after colorectal cancer surgery. This randomised control study recruited 66 subjects with indwelling urinary catheters after undergoing colorectal cancer surgery who later underwent catheter removal. Patients inhaled 1% lavender, 1% linalyl acetate, or vehicle (control group) for 20 minutes. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender or vehicle. Inhalation of linalyl acetate is an effective nursing intervention to relieve pain and urinary residual sense of indwelling urinary catheters following their removal from patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery.

2	3600348	Automatic tube compensation	In the Automatic tube compensation group (n = 17), 11 (65%) patients passed the spontaneous breathing trial with subsequent extubation failure (9%). While in pressure support ventilation group (n = 19), 10 (53%) patients passed the spontaneous breathing trial with subsequent extubation failure (10%). This represented a positive predictive value for Automatic tube compensation of 91% and pressure support ventilation of 90% (P = 0.52). TITLE: Automatic Tube Compensation versus Pressure Support Ventilation and Extubation Outcome in Children: A Randomized Controlled Study    ABSTRACT.   Background. Automatic tube compensation (Automatic tube compensation) has been developed to overcome the imposed work of breathing due to artificial airways during spontaneous breathing trials (spontaneous breathing trials). Objectives. This study aimed to assess extubation outcome after an spontaneous breathing trial (spontaneous breathing trial) with Automatic tube compensation compared with pressure support ventilation (pressure support ventilation) and to determine the risk factors for extubation failure. Methods. Patients ready for extubation were randomly assigned to two-hour spontaneous breathing trial with either Automatic tube compensation or pressure support ventilation. Results. Five (83%) of the patients who failed the spontaneous breathing trial in Automatic tube compensation group were reintubated. This represented a higher negative predictive value for Automatic tube compensation of 83% than for pressure support ventilation which was 56%. None of the assessed risk factors were independently associated with extubation failure including failed trial. Conclusion. Automatic tube compensation was equivalent to pressure support ventilation in predicting patients with successful extubation. A trial failure in Automatic tube compensation group is associated with but does not definitely predict extubation failure.

2	4459874	Albendazole	haemagglutination inhibition titers against both influenza A strains as well as memory B-cell response were modestly higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant. TITLE: Effect of Antihelminthic Treatment on Vaccine Immunogenicity to a Seasonal Influenza Vaccine in Primary School Children in Gabon: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Helminth infections are a major public health problem, especially in the tropics. Infected individuals have an altered immune response with evidence that antibody response to vaccination is impaired. Hence, treatment of helminth infections before vaccination may be a simple intervention to improve vaccine immunogenicity. In the present study we investigated whether a single-dose antihelminthic treatment influences antibody responses to a seasonal influenza vaccine in primary school children living in Gabon, Central Africa.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this placebo-controlled double-blind trial conducted in Gabon the effect of a single-dose antihelminthic treatment with 400 mg albendazole versus a placebo one month prior to immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine was investigated. Antiviral antibody titers against all three vaccine strains were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (haemagglutination inhibition) test at baseline (Day 0; vaccination) and four weeks (Day 28) as well as 12 weeks (Day 84) following vaccination. Vaccine-specific memory B-cell response was measured at Day 0 and Day 84 by vaccine-specific Enzyme-linked Immunospot (Enzyme-linked Immunospot) assay. The trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (Pan African Clinical Trials Registry) (PACTR201303000434188).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  98 school children aged 6–10 years were randomly allocated to receive either antihelminthic treatment or placebo and were vaccinated one month after the treatment. The prevalence of helminths at baseline was 21%. Vaccine-specific haemagglutination inhibition titers against at least one of the three vaccine strains increased at Day 28 and Day 84 in all participants. Total but not specific IgA was elevated in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group at Day 28.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In our setting antihelminthic treatment had no significant effect on influenza vaccine immunogenicity. A trend towards better antiviral and vaccine immunogenicity in the antihelminthic treated group encourages studies to be conducted with alternative treatment schedules or in populations with a higher helminth burden.

TITLE: Intervention with Delivery of Diabetic Meals Improves Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus    ABSTRACT.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diabetic meal delivery system on glycemic control over a 12 month period in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 77 patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned randomly into three dietary intervention groups: group M, diabetic meal delivery; group D, individual dietary counseling; and group C, conventional dietary education. In group M, HbA1c levels decreased significantly from 8.2 ± 1.2% to 7.4 ± 0.8% after 12 months (p<0.05), while in group D, HbA1c levels decreased significantly throughout the entire 12 month period, from 8.5 ± 1.7% at baseline to 7.4 ± 1.1% at the endpoint. There were no significant changes in either HbA1c or fasting blood glucose levels in group C. This study provides evidence that intervention with delivery of diabetic meals to patients with type 2 diabetes can be equally effective for achieving glycemic control as individual dietary counselling by a dietitian. Diabetic meal delivery can therefore be used successfully to provide diabetes education to outpatients.

This study provides evidence that intervention with delivery of diabetic meals to patients with type 2 diabetes can be equally effective for achieving glycemic control as individual dietary counselling by a dietitian. Diabetic meal delivery can therefore be used successfully to provide diabetes education to outpatients.

TITLE: Intervention with Delivery of Diabetic Meals Improves Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus    ABSTRACT.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diabetic meal delivery system on glycemic control over a 12 month period in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 77 patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned randomly into three dietary intervention groups: group M, diabetic meal delivery; group D, individual dietary counseling; and group C, conventional dietary education. Similarly, fasting blood glucose (fasting blood glucose) levels decreased significantly between 1 and 12 months in group M (p<0.05), and decreased significantly during the entire 12 month period in group D (p<0.01). There were no significant changes in either HbA1c or fasting blood glucose levels in group C.

2	3214395	group 1 included bispectral index (bispectral index) of 60, group 2 covered bispectral index (bispectral index) of 50	There were no differences in laryngoscopy duration and the occurrence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, extremity movement and awakening time among three groups.   TITLE: Comparative evaluation of different values of bispectral index in determination of the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia in pediatrics    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Induction of anesthesia is the most crucial period of general anesthesia. Inhalational induction is the most commonly used technique in pediatric anesthesia. Tracheal intubation can be done after reaching the deep levels of anesthesia. The depth of anesthesia is often difficult to be judged. Bispectral index is a measure of the effects of anesthesia on brain. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bispectral index (bispectral index) in clarifying suitable depth of anesthesia for tracheal intubation during inhalational induction of anesthesia.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  In a clinical trial, ninety patients, ASA I & II, 1 to 6 years old, scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled into the study. After starting bispectral index monitoring, patients randomly were divided into three groups. Then, anesthesia was induced by gradual increase of halothane in 50% mixture of oxygen (O2) and N2O and continued until target bispectral index (60 ± 2, 50 ± 2 and 40 ± 2) achieved. After tracheal intubation, the duration of laryngoscopy and the presence of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, laryngoscopy failure, the movement of extremities and the changes in SpO2 and bispectral index were recorded. The data were analyzed by chi-square and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  bispectral index could not determine the appropriate level of anesthesia for tracheal intubation in this setting. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  These results confirmed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications related to intubation at different bispectral index values (from 60 to 40) during inhalation induction, and probably to achieve an adequate or more reliable depth of anesthesia, the lower values of bispectral index is required.

2	2546382	Exenatide	Using the most conservative of assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratio of exenatide vs. insulin glargine at the current UK NHS price was -£29,149/QALY (insulin glargine dominant) and thus exenatide is not cost-effective when compared with insulin glargine, at the current UK NHS price.   TITLE: Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with sub-optimally controlled Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  Exenatide belongs to a new therapeutic class in the treatment of diabetes (incretin mimetics), allowing glucose-dependent glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial data suggest that exenatide is as effective as insulin glargine at reducing HbA1c in combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylureas; with reduced weight but higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine using RCT data and a previously published model of Type 2 diabetes disease progression that is based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study; the perspective of the health-payer of the United Kingdom National Health Service.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study used a discrete event simulation model designed to forecast the costs and health outcome of a cohort of 1,000 subjects aged over 40 years with sub-optimally-controlled Type 2 diabetes, following initiation of either exenatide, or insulin glargine, in addition to oral hypoglycaemic agents. Sensitivity analysis for a higher treatment discontinuation rate in exenatide patients was applied to the cohort in three different scenarios; (1) either ignored or (2) exenatide-failures excluded or (3) exenatide-failures switched to insulin glargine. Analyses were undertaken to evaluate the price sensitivity of exenatide in terms of relative cost effectiveness. Baseline cohort profiles and effectiveness data were taken from a published randomised controlled trial.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The relative cost-effectiveness of exenatide and insulin glargine was tested under a variety of conditions, in which insulin glargine was dominant in all cases. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study evaluated the relative cost effectiveness of insulin glargine versus exenatide in the management of Type 2 diabetes using a published model. Given no significant difference in glycaemic control and applying the additional effectiveness of exenatide over insulin glargine, with respect to weight loss, and using the current UK NHS prices, insulin glargine was found to be dominant over exenatide in all modelled scenarios. With current clinical evidence, exenatide does not appear to represent a cost-effective treatment option for patients with Type 2 diabetes when compared to insulin glargine.
1	2546382	Insulin glargine	Using the most conservative of assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratio of exenatide vs. insulin glargine at the current UK NHS price was -£29,149/QALY (insulin glargine dominant) and thus exenatide is not cost-effective when compared with insulin glargine, at the current UK NHS price.   TITLE: Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine in patients with sub-optimally controlled Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  Exenatide belongs to a new therapeutic class in the treatment of diabetes (incretin mimetics), allowing glucose-dependent glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes. Randomised controlled trial data suggest that exenatide is as effective as insulin glargine at reducing HbA1c in combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylureas; with reduced weight but higher incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of exenatide versus insulin glargine using RCT data and a previously published model of Type 2 diabetes disease progression that is based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study; the perspective of the health-payer of the United Kingdom National Health Service.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The study used a discrete event simulation model designed to forecast the costs and health outcome of a cohort of 1,000 subjects aged over 40 years with sub-optimally-controlled Type 2 diabetes, following initiation of either exenatide, or insulin glargine, in addition to oral hypoglycaemic agents. Sensitivity analysis for a higher treatment discontinuation rate in exenatide patients was applied to the cohort in three different scenarios; (1) either ignored or (2) exenatide-failures excluded or (3) exenatide-failures switched to insulin glargine. Analyses were undertaken to evaluate the price sensitivity of exenatide in terms of relative cost effectiveness. Baseline cohort profiles and effectiveness data were taken from a published randomised controlled trial.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The relative cost-effectiveness of exenatide and insulin glargine was tested under a variety of conditions, in which insulin glargine was dominant in all cases. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study evaluated the relative cost effectiveness of insulin glargine versus exenatide in the management of Type 2 diabetes using a published model.

TITLE: Impact of Prior Chemotherapy Use on the Efficacy of Everolimus in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) by prior chemotherapy use in the RAD001 in Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors, Third Trial (RADIANT-3).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients with advanced, progressive, low- or intermediate-grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were prospectively stratified by prior chemotherapy use and World Health Organization performance status and were randomly assigned (1:1) to everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 207) or placebo (n = 203).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Of the 410 patients, 204 (50%) were naive to chemotherapy (chemonaive). Baseline characteristics were similar for patients with or without prior chemotherapy. Stable disease was the best overall response in 73% of everolimus-treated patients (151/207). The most common drug-related adverse events included stomatitis (60%–69%), rash (47%–50%), and diarrhea (34%).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  As more treatment options become available, it is important to consider the goals of treatment and to identify patients who would potentially benefit from a specific therapy. Findings from this planned subgroup analysis suggest the potential for first-line use of everolimus in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

TITLE: Randomized control trial of high fidelity vs low fidelity simulation for training undergraduate students in neonatal resuscitation    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.   Knowledge acquisition and skill maintenance are important in learning neonatal resuscitation. Traditionally this is taught by using low fidelity mannequins. Technological advancement enabled a move towards high fidelity mannequins. In a low resources setting, it is incumbent to ensure reasonable cost benefit ratio before investing in technology.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A randomized control trial was conducted in 101 undergraduate students who were assigned to conventional Resusci® Baby Basic or SimNewB group over a period of 3 days. The lectures were the same for both groups but the hands on training was on different mannequins. There were five experienced and accredited teachers who were standardized for training the students. Both the groups received a written test and a Megacode before and after the training, and 3 months later a post-test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The baseline written exam score (p = 0.07), Megacode assessment score (p = 0.19) and sex distribution (p = 0.17) were similar in both groups. Both groups showed significant improvement in the written exam score as well as in the Megacode assessment score at post-test and 3 months (retention) period. Further the post-test and 3 month scores were comparable for the skills as well as content components suggesting that the skills were retained in 3 months with an opportunity of self learning them.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Due diligence is a caveat before contemplating the acquisition of high fidelity mannequins by educational centers for neonatal resuscitation.

TITLE: The effects of pre- and post-exercise consumption of multi-ingredient performance supplements on cardiovascular health and body fat in trained men after six weeks of resistance training: a stratified, randomized, double-blind study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The cardiovascular (cardiovascular) and metabolic health benefits or risks associated with consumption of multi-ingredient performance supplements (multi-ingredient performance supplements) in conjunction with periodized resistance training (resistance training) in resistance-trained men are unknown. This population is a major target audience for performance supplements, and therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effect of resistance training and commercially available pre- and post-exercise performance supplements on cardiovascular health and body fat in resistance-trained men.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Twenty-four resistance-trained men completed six weeks (three times/week) of periodized resistance training while either ingesting SHOT 15-min pre-exercise and SYN immediately post-exercise (multi-ingredient performance supplement group: multi-ingredient performance supplements) or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo 15-min pre-exercise and immediately post-exercise (Placebo group). Before and after six weeks of resistance training and supplementation, resting heart rate (heart rate), blood pressure (blood pressure), total body fat, android fat, gynoid fat, fat-free mass (fat, fat-free mass) and fasting blood measures of glucose, lipids, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), cortisol and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured. Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way ANOVA for baseline differences and a 2 × 2 (group × time) repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests where appropriate. Significance was set at p < 0.05.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  However, there was a time effect where significant decreases in body fat (mean ± SD; multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.2 ± 1.2%; Placebo: -0.9 ± 1.1%), android fat (multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.8 ± 2.1%; Placebo: -1.6 ± 2.0%), and gynoid fat (multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.3 ± 1.6%; Placebo: -1.0 ± 1.4%) for both groups were observed. fat, fat-free mass increased in both groups, and a group × time interaction was observed with multi-ingredient performance supplements increasing significantly more than the Placebo group (4.2% vs. 1.9%).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Six weeks of multi-ingredient performance supplements ingestion and periodized resistance training does not alter cardiovascular health parameters or blood indices of health or body fat more than a Placebo treatment in healthy, resistance-trained men. However, multi-ingredient performance supplements significantly increased fat, fat-free mass more than Placebo.

The cardiovascular (cardiovascular) and metabolic health benefits or risks associated with consumption of multi-ingredient performance supplements (multi-ingredient performance supplements) in conjunction with periodized resistance training (resistance training) in resistance-trained men are unknown. This population is a major target audience for performance supplements, and therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effect of resistance training and commercially available pre- and post-exercise performance supplements on cardiovascular health and body fat in resistance-trained men.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Twenty-four resistance-trained men completed six weeks (three times/week) of periodized resistance training while either ingesting SHOT 15-min pre-exercise and SYN immediately post-exercise (multi-ingredient performance supplement group: multi-ingredient performance supplements) or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo 15-min pre-exercise and immediately post-exercise (Placebo group). Before and after six weeks of resistance training and supplementation, resting heart rate (heart rate), blood pressure (blood pressure), total body fat, android fat, gynoid fat, fat-free mass (fat, fat-free mass) and fasting blood measures of glucose, lipids, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), cortisol and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured. Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way ANOVA for baseline differences and a 2 × 2 (group × time) repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests where appropriate. Significance was set at p < 0.05.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  There was no group × time interaction for heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, NOx, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, cortisol concentrations or body fat. However, there was a time effect where significant decreases in body fat (mean ± SD; multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.2 ± 1.2%; Placebo: -0.9 ± 1.1%), android fat (multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.8 ± 2.1%; Placebo: -1.6 ± 2.0%), and gynoid fat (multi-ingredient performance supplements: -1.3 ± 1.6%; Placebo: -1.0 ± 1.4%) for both groups were observed. fat, fat-free mass increased in both groups, and a group × time interaction was observed with multi-ingredient performance supplements increasing significantly more than the Placebo group (4.2% vs. 1.9%).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS. 
0	3662597	Total body mass and fat-free mass	Six weeks of multi-ingredient performance supplements ingestion and periodized resistance training does not alter cardiovascular health parameters or blood indices of health or body fat more than a Placebo treatment in healthy, resistance-trained men. However, multi-ingredient performance supplements significantly increased fat, fat-free mass more than Placebo.

TITLE: The Influence of User Characteristics and a Periodic Email Prompt on Exposure to an Internet-Delivered Computer-Tailored Lifestyle Program    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The Internet is a promising medium in the field of health promotion for offering tailored and targeted lifestyle interventions applying computer-tailored (computer-tailored) techniques to the general public. Actual exposure to computer-tailored interventions is not living up to its high expectations, as only a (limited) proportion of the target group is actually using these programs.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To investigate exposure to an Internet-delivered, computer-tailored lifestyle intervention, targeting physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking behavior, and alcohol intake, we focused on three processes: first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. The first objectives were to identify user characteristics that predict initiation of an online computer-tailored lifestyle program (first use) and completion of this program (prolonged use). Furthermore, we studied the effect of using a proactive strategy, consisting of periodic email prompts, on program revisits (sustained use).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  The research population for this study consisted of Dutch adults participating in the Adult Health Monitor, offered by the regional public health services. We used a randomized controlled trial design to assess predictors of first use, prolonged use, and sustained use. Demographics and behavioral characteristics, as well as the strategy used for revisiting, were included as predictors in the model.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A total of 9169 participants indicated their interest in the new program and 5168 actually logged in to the program. Participants significantly more likely to initiate one of the computer-tailored modules were male, older, and employed, and had a lower income, higher body mass index, and relatively unhealthy lifestyle. Participants significantly more likely to complete one of the computer-tailored modules were older and had a higher income and a relatively healthier lifestyle. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Older, male, and employed participants, and those with a lower income, higher body mass index, and a relatively unhealthy lifestyle were more likely to initiate a computer-tailored module. Module completers predominantly had a higher income and age. The current program therefore succeeded in reaching those people who benefit most from online lifestyle interventions. However, these people tended to disengage from the program. This underlines the importance of additional research into program adjustments and strategies that can be used to stimulate prolonged program use. Furthermore, sending periodic email prompts significantly increased revisits to the program. Though promising, this effect was modest and needs to be further examined, in order to maximize the potential of periodic email prompting.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

TITLE: Is pharmacologic treatment better than neural mobilization for cervicobrachial pain? A randomized clinical trial    ABSTRACT.  Purpose: This study aim was to compare the effectiveness of the median nerve neural mobilization (median nerve neural mobilization) and cervical lateral glide (cervical lateral glide) intervention versus oral ibuprofen (oral ibuprofen) in subjects who suffer cervicobrachial pain (cervicobrachial pain).   Methods: This investigation was a, multicenter, blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT02595294; NCT02593721). A number of 105 individuals diagnosed with cervicobrachial pain were enrolled in the study and treated in 2 different medical facilities from July to November 2015. Participants were recruited and randomly assigned into 3 groups of 35 subjects. Intervention groups received median nerve neural mobilization or cervical lateral glide neurodynamic treatments, and the (active treatment) control group received an oral ibuprofen treatment for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was pain intensity reported through the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (Numeric Rating Scale for Pain). Secondary outcomes were physical function involving the affected upper limb using the Quick DASH scale, and ipsilateral cervical rotation (ipsilateral cervical rotation) using a cervical range of motion (cervical range of motion) device. Assessments were performed before and 1 hour after treatment for Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (baseline, 3 and 6 weeks) and cervical range of motion (baseline and 6 weeks), as well as only 1 assessment for Quick DASH (baseline and 6 weeks).   Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA intergroup statistically significant differences were shown for cervicobrachial pain intensity (F(2,72) = 22.343; P < .001; Eta2 = 0.383) and Quick DASH (F(2,72) = 15.338; P < .001; Eta2 = 0.299), although not for cervical range of motion (F(2,72) = 1.434; P = .245; Eta2 = 0.038). Conclusions: oral ibuprofen pharmacologic treatment may reduce pain intensity and disability with respect to neural mobilization (median nerve neural mobilization and cervical lateral glide) in patients with cervicobrachial pain during six weeks. Nevertheless, the non-existence of between-groups ROM differences and possible oral ibuprofen adverse effects should be considered.

TITLE: Effect of integrated yoga therapy on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of the knee joint: A randomized control study    ABSTRACT.AIM:.  To study the effect of integrated yoga on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of knees.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Two hundred and fifty participants with OA knees (35–80 years) were randomly assigned to yoga or control group. Both groups had transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment followed by intervention (40 min) for two weeks with follow up for three months. The integrated yoga consisted of yogic loosening and strengthening practices, asanas, relaxation, pranayama and meditation. The control group had physiotherapy exercises. Assessments were done on 15th (post 1) and 90th day (post 2).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Resting pain (numerical rating scale) reduced better (P<0.001, Mann–Whitney U test) in yoga group (post 1=33.6% and post 2=71.8%) than control group (post 1=13.4% and post 2=37.5%). State anxiety (STAI-1) reduced (P<0.001) by 35.5% (post 1) and 58.4% (post 2) in the yoga group and 15.6% (post 1) and 38.8% (post 2) in the control group; trait anxiety (STAI 2) reduced (P<0.001) better (post 1=34.6% and post 2=57.10%) in yoga than control group (post 1=14.12% and post 2=34.73%). Systolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=−7.93% and post 2=−15.7%) than the control group (post 1=−1.8% and post 2=−3.8%). Diastolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=−7.6% and post 2=−16.4%) than the control group (post 1=−2.1% and post 2=−5.0%). Pulse rate reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=−8.41% and post 2=−12.4%) than the control group (post 1=−5.1% and post 2=−7.1%).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Integrated approach of yoga therapy is better than physiotherapy exercises as an adjunct to transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment in reducing pain, morning stiffness, state and trait anxiety, blood pressure and pulse rate in patients with OA knees.

To study the effect of integrated yoga on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of knees.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Two hundred and fifty participants with OA knees (35–80 years) were randomly assigned to yoga or control group. Both groups had transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment followed by intervention (40 min) for two weeks with follow up for three months. The integrated yoga consisted of yogic loosening and strengthening practices, asanas, relaxation, pranayama and meditation. The control group had physiotherapy exercises. Assessments were done on 15th (post 1) and 90th day (post 2).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Resting pain (numerical rating scale) reduced better (P<0.001, Mann–Whitney U test) in yoga group (post 1=33.6% and post 2=71.8%) than control group (post 1=13.4% and post 2=37.5%). Morning stiffness decreased more (P<0.001) in yoga (post 1=68.6% and post 2=98.1%) than control group (post 1=38.6% and post 2=71.6%). State anxiety (STAI-1) reduced (P<0.001) by 35.5% (post 1) and 58.4% (post 2) in the yoga group and 15.6% (post 1) and 38.8% (post 2) in the control group; trait anxiety (STAI 2) reduced (P<0.001) better (post 1=34.6% and post 2=57.10%) in yoga than control group (post 1=14.12% and post 2=34.73%). Systolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=−7.93% and post 2=−15.7%) than the control group (post 1=−1.8% and post 2=−3.8%). Diastolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=−7.6% and post 2=−16.4%) than the control group (post 1=−2.1% and post 2=−5.0%). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Integrated approach of yoga therapy is better than physiotherapy exercises as an adjunct to transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment in reducing pain, morning stiffness, state and trait anxiety, blood pressure and pulse rate in patients with OA knees.

2	1764008	Meperidine analgesia	There was no statistical difference in rates of vacuum-assisted delivery rate. TITLE: Effects of epidural lidocaine analgesia on labor and delivery: A randomized, prospective, controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Whether epidural analgesia for labor prolongs the active-first and second labor stages and increases the risk of vacuum-assisted delivery is a controversial topic. Our study was conducted to answer the question: does lumbar epidural analgesia with lidocaine affect the progress of labor in our obstetric population?   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  395 healthy, nulliparous women, at term, presented in spontaneous labor with a singleton vertex presentation. These patients were randomized to receive analgesia either, epidural with bolus doses of 1% lidocaine or intravenous, with meperidine 25 to 50 mg when their cervix was dilated to 4 centimeters. The duration of the active-first and second stages of labor and the neonatal apgar scores were recorded, in each patient. The total number of vacuum-assisted and cesarean deliveries were also measured.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  197 women were randomized to the epidural group. 198 women were randomized to the single-dose intravenous meperidine group. Cesarean deliveries, as a consequence of fetal bradycardia or dystocia, did not differ significantly between the groups. Differences in the duration of the active-first and the second stages of labor were not statistically significant. The number of newborns with 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores less than 7, did not differ significantly between both analgesia groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Epidural analgesia with 1% lidocaine does not prolong the active-first and second stages of labor and does not increase vacuum-assisted or cesarean delivery rate.

ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS.  460 participants (46.6% female; 13.2 (0.4) years old).   ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS.  8-week intervention (2013) involved: classes choosing weekly activities encouraged by mentors (older adolescents) and in-class peer leaders. Students gain points for trying activities which are entered into an intramural competition.   ABSTRACT.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES.  Planned quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (focus groups) process evaluation addressed enjoyment, confidence, participation, suggested improvements. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up (week 8) in pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial and included accelerometer-assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; adolescent-reported activity type, well-being, peer support, shyness, sociability. Analysis of covariance was used to assess preliminary effectiveness as change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity adjusted for baseline.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  All year 9 students in intervention schools were exposed to the intervention; over all schools 77% of eligible students were measured. 71% boys and 74% girls found GoActive 'fun'; 38% boys and 32% girls said it increased confidence, and 64% boys and 59% girls said they would continue with a GoActive activity. Suggested improvements included more mentorship; improved training; streamlined points recording. Pilot results indicated potential effectiveness ((adjusted mean difference (95% CI) p value; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity mins; 5.1 (1.1 to 9.2) p=0.014)) and suggest recruitment of 16 schools (2400 adolescents) for a full trial. Participation in activity types approached significance (intervention group 2.3 (−0.2 to 4.7) p=0.07 more activity types).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Results suggest feasibility and indicate potential effectiveness of GoActive to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and support a fully powered evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Process evaluation data were used to refine GoActive prior to a full trial.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER.  ISRCTN31583496; pre-results.

2	1332199	fentanyl, sufentanil	Results: Post operative pain scores were significantly lower in the fentanyl and sufentanil groups compared to remifentanil group (55 ± 15, and 60 ± 10 versus 78± 12, P < 0.05). TITLE: Postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements after thyroid surgery: Comparison of three intraoperative opioid regimens    ABSTRACT.  Purpose: This study was designed to compare the effect on postoperative pain, opioid consumption and the length of stay in postoperative care unit (postoperative care unit) after three different intraoperative analgesic regimens in thyroid surgery. Methods: Seventy five patients were enrolled into the study and assigned to one of three groups, fentanyl, sufentanil or remifentanil (n=25 for each group). Before the end of surgery, paracetamol 1 gr and nefopam 20 mg was also administered in all patients. Pain scores, opioid demand and the length of stay in postoperative care unit were assessed in a blind manner. Patients in the remifentanil group stayed longer in the postoperative care unit 108± 37 min versus 78±31 and 73 ± 25 min, (P< 0.05). Conclusion: After remifentanil based analgesia, anticipation of postoperative pain with opioid analgesic appears mandatory even for surgery rated as being moderately painful, otherwise longer opioid titration due to higher pain scores might delay discharge time.

2	2714198	Suture groups	Results: No difference in survival time was observed across the different groups. TITLE: The Effect of Anchoring Sutures on Medicinal Leech Mortality    ABSTRACT.  Objective: The implementation of leech therapy for surgical flaps is not always logistically easy or comfortable for patients or healthcare providers. We examine different methods of placing sutures in the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, to make the implementation of leech therapy easier. Methods: Sixteen leeches were randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group, a deep anchoring suture group, and a superficial anchoring suture group. The leeches were observed to determine if either of these methods had an adverse effect on survival compared with the control group. Conclusion: The placement of anchoring sutures in leeches can ease the implementation of leech therapy by allowing for greater control of the leeches and thus increased patient comfort.

2	4114185	Brain-Computer Interface + Haptic Knob	Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment score improved in all groups, but no intergroup differences were found at any time points. TITLE: Brain-computer interface-based robotic end effector system for wrist and hand rehabilitation: results of a three-armed randomized controlled trial for chronic stroke    ABSTRACT.  The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (Motor Imagery) Brain-Computer Interface (Brain-Computer Interface) coupled with a Haptic Knob (Haptic Knob) robot for arm rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial; 21 chronic hemiplegic stroke patients (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment) score 10–50), recruited after pre-screening for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface ability, were randomly allocated to BCI-HK, Haptic Knob or Standard Arm Therapy (Standard Arm Therapy) groups. All groups received 18 sessions of intervention over 6 weeks, 3 sessions per week, 90 min per session. The BCI-HK group received 1 h of Brain-Computer Interface coupled with Haptic Knob intervention, and the Haptic Knob group received 1 h of Haptic Knob intervention per session. Both BCI-HK and Haptic Knob groups received 120 trials of robot-assisted hand grasping and knob manipulation followed by 30 min of therapist-assisted arm mobilization. The Standard Arm Therapy group received 1.5 h of therapist-assisted arm mobilization and forearm pronation-supination movements incorporating wrist control and grasp-release functions. In all, 14 males, 7 females, mean age 54.2 years, mean stroke duration 385.1 days, with baseline Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment score 27.0 were recruited. The primary outcome measure was upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment scores measured mid-intervention at week 3, end-intervention at week 6, and follow-up at weeks 12 and 24. Seven, 8 and 7 subjects underwent BCI-HK, Haptic Knob and Standard Arm Therapy interventions respectively. Significantly larger motor gains were observed in the BCI-HK group compared to the Standard Arm Therapy group at weeks 3, 12, and 24, but motor gains in the Haptic Knob group did not differ from the Standard Arm Therapy group at any time point.

TITLE: Brain-computer interface-based robotic end effector system for wrist and hand rehabilitation: results of a three-armed randomized controlled trial for chronic stroke    ABSTRACT.  The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (Motor Imagery) Brain-Computer Interface (Brain-Computer Interface) coupled with a Haptic Knob (Haptic Knob) robot for arm rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial; 21 chronic hemiplegic stroke patients (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment) score 10–50), recruited after pre-screening for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface ability, were randomly allocated to BCI-HK, Haptic Knob or Standard Arm Therapy (Standard Arm Therapy) groups. All groups received 18 sessions of intervention over 6 weeks, 3 sessions per week, 90 min per session. The BCI-HK group received 1 h of Brain-Computer Interface coupled with Haptic Knob intervention, and the Haptic Knob group received 1 h of Haptic Knob intervention per session. Both BCI-HK and Haptic Knob groups received 120 trials of robot-assisted hand grasping and knob manipulation followed by 30 min of therapist-assisted arm mobilization. The Standard Arm Therapy group received 1.5 h of therapist-assisted arm mobilization and forearm pronation-supination movements incorporating wrist control and grasp-release functions. In all, 14 males, 7 females, mean age 54.2 years, mean stroke duration 385.1 days, with baseline Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment score 27.0 were recruited. The primary outcome measure was upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment scores measured mid-intervention at week 3, end-intervention at week 6, and follow-up at weeks 12 and 24. Seven, 8 and 7 subjects underwent BCI-HK, Haptic Knob and Standard Arm Therapy interventions respectively. Significantly larger motor gains were observed in the BCI-HK group compared to the Standard Arm Therapy group at weeks 3, 12, and 24, but motor gains in the Haptic Knob group did not differ from the Standard Arm Therapy group at any time point. In conclusion, BCI-HK is effective, safe, and may have the potential for enhancing motor recovery in chronic stroke when combined with therapist-assisted arm mobilization.

2	5133227	Tube-exchanger	In the tube-exchanger group, the success rate of nasogastric tube insertion on the first attempt was 92%, which is significantly higher than 68%, the rate in the control group (P = 0.007). TITLE: Nasogastric tube insertion using airway tube exchanger in anesthetized and intubated patients    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  A nasogastric tube (nasogastric tube) is commonly inserted into patients undergoing abdominal surgery to decompress the stomach during or after surgery. However, for anatomic reasons, the insertion of nasogastric tubes into anesthetized and intubated patients may be challenging. We hypothesized that the use of a tube exchanger for nasogastric tube insertion could increase the success rate and reduce complications.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  One hundred adult patients, aged 20–70 years, who were scheduled for gastrointestinal surgeries with general anesthesia and nasogastric tube insertion were enrolled in our study. The patients were randomly allocated to the tube-exchanger group or the control group. The number of attempts, the time required for successful nasogastric tube insertion, and the complications were noted for each patient.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The time required for successful nasogastric tube insertion in the tube-exchanger group was 18.5 ± 8.2 seconds, which is significantly shorter than the control group, 75.1 ± 9.8 seconds (P < 0.001). Complications such as laryngeal bleeding and the kinking and knotting of the nasogastric tube occurred less often in the tube-exchanger group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  There were many advantages in using a tube-exchanger as a guide to inserting nasogastric tubes in anesthetized and intubated patients. Compared to the conventional technique, the use of a tube-exchanger resulted in a higher the success rate of insertion on the first attempt, a shorter procedure time, and fewer complications.

TITLE: A Randomised Trial of Subcutaneous Intermittent Interleukin-2 without Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients: The UK–Vanguard Study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  The objective of the trial was to evaluate in a pilot setting the safety and efficacy of interleukin-2 (interleukin-2) therapy when used without concomitant antiretroviral therapy as a treatment for HIV infection.   ABSTRACT.DESIGN AND SETTING:.  This was a multicentre randomised three-arm trial conducted between September 1998 and March 2001 at three clinical centres in the United Kingdom.   ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS:.  Participants were 36 antiretroviral treatment naïve HIV-1-infected patients with baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts of at least 350 cells/mm3.   ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS:.  Participants were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 at 15 million international units (million international units) per day (12 participants) or 9 MIU/day (12 participants) or no treatment (12 participants). interleukin-2 was administered by twice-daily subcutaneous injections for five consecutive days every 8 wk.   ABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASURES:.  Primary outcome was the change from baseline CD4 T lymphocyte count at 24 wk. Safety and plasma HIV RNA levels were also monitored every 4 wk through 24 wk. The two interleukin-2 dose groups were combined for the primary analysis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Area under curve (Area under curve) for change in the mean CD4 T lymphocyte count through 24 wk was 129 cells/mm3 for those assigned interleukin-2 (both dose groups combined) and 13 cells/mm3 for control participants (95% CI for difference, 51.3–181.2 cells/mm3; p = 0.0009). There were no significant differences between the interleukin-2 (0.13 log10 copies/ml) and control (0.09 log10 copies/ml) groups for Area under curve of change in plasma HIV RNA over the 24-wk period of follow-up (95% CI for difference, −0.17 to 0.26; p = 0.70). Grade 4 and dose-limiting side effects were in keeping with those previously reported for interleukin-2 therapy.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  In participants with HIV infection and baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts of at least 350 cells/mm3, intermittent subcutaneous interleukin-2 without concomitant antiretroviral therapy was well tolerated and produced significant increases in CD4 T lymphocyte counts and did not adversely affect plasma HIV RNA levels.

TITLE: A Randomised Trial of Subcutaneous Intermittent Interleukin-2 without Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients: The UK–Vanguard Study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  The objective of the trial was to evaluate in a pilot setting the safety and efficacy of interleukin-2 (interleukin-2) therapy when used without concomitant antiretroviral therapy as a treatment for HIV infection.   ABSTRACT.DESIGN AND SETTING:.  This was a multicentre randomised three-arm trial conducted between September 1998 and March 2001 at three clinical centres in the United Kingdom.   ABSTRACT.PARTICIPANTS:.  Participants were 36 antiretroviral treatment naïve HIV-1-infected patients with baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts of at least 350 cells/mm3.   ABSTRACT.INTERVENTIONS:.  Participants were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 at 15 million international units (million international units) per day (12 participants) or 9 MIU/day (12 participants) or no treatment (12 participants). interleukin-2 was administered by twice-daily subcutaneous injections for five consecutive days every 8 wk.   ABSTRACT.OUTCOME MEASURES:.  Primary outcome was the change from baseline CD4 T lymphocyte count at 24 wk. Safety and plasma HIV RNA levels were also monitored every 4 wk through 24 wk. The two interleukin-2 dose groups were combined for the primary analysis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Area under curve (Area under curve) for change in the mean CD4 T lymphocyte count through 24 wk was 129 cells/mm3 for those assigned interleukin-2 (both dose groups combined) and 13 cells/mm3 for control participants (95% CI for difference, 51.3–181.2 cells/mm3; p = 0.0009). There were no significant differences between the interleukin-2 (0.13 log10 copies/ml) and control (0.09 log10 copies/ml) groups for Area under curve of change in plasma HIV RNA over the 24-wk period of follow-up (95% CI for difference, −0.17 to 0.26; p = 0.70). Grade 4 and dose-limiting side effects were in keeping with those previously reported for interleukin-2 therapy.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  In participants with HIV infection and baseline CD4 T lymphocyte counts of at least 350 cells/mm3, intermittent subcutaneous interleukin-2 without concomitant antiretroviral therapy was well tolerated and produced significant increases in CD4 T lymphocyte counts and did not adversely affect plasma HIV RNA levels.

2	3586143	Rifampicin 600mg/day+ vandetanib 300mg on day 10	Results: Study A: coadministration of vandetanib with rifampicin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in AUC504 (geometric least square [GLS]mean ratio [vandetanib + rifampicin/vandetanib alone] 0.60; 90% CI 0.58, 0.63). TITLE: Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions with Vandetanib during Coadministration with Rifampicin or Itraconazole    ABSTRACT.  Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin (Study A), and a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole (Study B), on the pharmacokinetics of a single 300mg dose of vandetanib in healthy subjects.   Study Design and Setting: Two phase I, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, single-center studies. Participants and Intervention: Study A: 18 healthy male subjects aged 21–44 years were randomized to receive each of the following two regimens, separated by a ≥6-week washout period: (i) oral rifampicin 600mg/day on days 1–31 with a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 10; and (ii) a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 1. Study B: 16 healthy male subjects aged 20–44 years were randomized to receive each of the following two regimens, separated by a 3-month washout period: (i) oral itraconazole 200mg/day on days 1–24 with a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 4; and (ii) a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 1.   Main Outcome Measure: Blood samples for measurement of vandetanib (both studies) concentrations and its metabolites, N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide (Study A only), were collected before and at various timepoints after vandetanib administration for up to 28 days (Study A) and 37 days (Study B). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 504 hours (AUC504) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of vandetanib were compared in the presence and absence of rifampicin, and in the presence and absence of itraconazole.   There was no significant difference in Cmax of vandetanib (GLSmean ratio 1.03; 90% CI 0.95, 1.11). AUC504 and Cmax of N-desmethylvandetanib increased by 266.0% and 414.3%, respectively, in the presence of rifampicin compared with vandetanib alone. Exposure to vandetanib N-oxide was very low compared with that of vandetanib, but was increased in the presence of rifampicin. Study B: coadministration of vandetanib with itraconazole resulted in a significant increase in AUC504 (GLSmean ratio [vandetanib + itraconazole/vandetanib alone] 1.09; 90% CI 1.01, 1.18) and no significant change in Cmax (GLSmean ratio 0.96; 90% CI 0.83, 1.11). Vandetanib was well tolerated in both studies.   Conclusions: Exposure to vandetanib, as assessed byAUC504 in healthy subjects, was reduced by around 40% when a single dose was given in combination with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. Because of this, it may be appropriate to avoid coadministration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with vandetanib. Vandetanib exposure was increased by about 9% when it was taken in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. It is unlikely that coadministration of vandetanib and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors will need to be contraindicated.

The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 504 hours (AUC504) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of vandetanib were compared in the presence and absence of rifampicin, and in the presence and absence of itraconazole.   Results: Study A: coadministration of vandetanib with rifampicin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in AUC504 (geometric least square [GLS]mean ratio [vandetanib + rifampicin/vandetanib alone] 0.60; 90% CI 0.58, 0.63). AUC504 and Cmax of N-desmethylvandetanib increased by 266.0% and 414.3%, respectively, in the presence of rifampicin compared with vandetanib alone. Exposure to vandetanib N-oxide was very low compared with that of vandetanib, but was increased in the presence of rifampicin. Study B: coadministration of vandetanib with itraconazole resulted in a significant increase in AUC504 (GLSmean ratio [vandetanib + itraconazole/vandetanib alone] 1.09; 90% CI 1.01, 1.18) and no significant change in Cmax (GLSmean ratio 0.96; 90% CI 0.83, 1.11). Vandetanib was well tolerated in both studies.   Conclusions: Exposure to vandetanib, as assessed byAUC504 in healthy subjects, was reduced by around 40% when a single dose was given in combination with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. Because of this, it may be appropriate to avoid coadministration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with vandetanib. Vandetanib exposure was increased by about 9% when it was taken in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. It is unlikely that coadministration of vandetanib and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors will need to be contraindicated.

TITLE: Nurse led versus lay educators support for those with asthma in primary care: a costing study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Regular review and support for asthma self-management is promoted in guidelines. A randomised controlled trial suggested that unscheduled health care usage was similar when patients were offered self management support by a lay-trainer or practice nurses.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Following the RCT, a costing study was undertaken using the trial data to account for the cost of delivery of the service under both strategies and the resulting impact on unscheduled healthcare (measure of effectiveness) in this trial.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  One year data (n = 418) showed that 29% (61/205) of the nurse group required unscheduled healthcare (177 events) compared with 30.5% (65/213) for lay-trainers (178 events).   If the cost of unscheduled healthcare are accounted for then the costs of nurses is £161, and £135 for lay-trainers (mean difference £25, [95% CI = −£97, £149, p = 0.681]). The total costs (delivery and unscheduled healthcare) were £202 per patient for nurses versus £178 for lay-trainers, (mean difference £24, [95%CI = −£100, £147, p = 0.707]).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  There were no significant differences in the cost of training and healthcare delivery between nurse and lay trainers, and no significant difference in the cost of unscheduled health care use.

A randomised controlled trial suggested that unscheduled health care usage was similar when patients were offered self management support by a lay-trainer or practice nurses.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Following the RCT, a costing study was undertaken using the trial data to account for the cost of delivery of the service under both strategies and the resulting impact on unscheduled healthcare (measure of effectiveness) in this trial.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  One year data (n = 418) showed that 29% (61/205) of the nurse group required unscheduled healthcare (177 events) compared with 30.5% (65/213) for lay-trainers (178 events).   If the cost of unscheduled healthcare are accounted for then the costs of nurses is £161, and £135 for lay-trainers (mean difference £25, [95% CI = −£97, £149, p = 0.681]). The total costs (delivery and unscheduled healthcare) were £202 per patient for nurses versus £178 for lay-trainers, (mean difference £24, [95%CI = −£100, £147, p = 0.707]).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  There were no significant differences in the cost of training and healthcare delivery between nurse and lay trainers, and no significant difference in the cost of unscheduled health care use.

2	4341337	Ciclesonide + Levocetirizine	Significant improvements in rTNSS, physician-assessed overall nasal signs and symptoms severity, and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaires in the ciclesonide monotherapy group were observed in comparison to the levocetirizine alone group. TITLE: Comparison of Intranasal Ciclesonide, Oral Levocetirizine, and Combination Treatment for Allergic Rhinitis    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily ciclesonide in comparison to both levocetirizine alone, and a ciclesonide/levocetirizine combination in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergic rhinitis) and perennial allergic rhinitis (perennial allergic rhinitis).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Subjects exhibiting moderate to severe allergic rhinitis for longer than 1 year were randomized in an open-label, 3-arm, parallel group, multicenter study. Subjects received 200 μg ciclesonide, 5 mg levocetirizine, or a combination of both. Changes from baseline until the end-of-study visit (2 weeks following) were evaluated by reflective total nasal symptom scores (reflective total nasal symptom scores), reflective total ocular symptom scores (reflective total ocular symptom scores), physician-assessed overall nasal signs and symptoms severity (physician-assessed overall nasal signs and symptoms severity), and rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaires (rhinoconjunctivitis quality-of-life questionnaires).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Three individual symptoms of rTNSS, including runny nose, nasal itching, and congestion, were improved in the ciclesonide-treated group. rTOSS scores for ciclesonide monotherapy improved from baseline, but no superiority over levocetirizine was shown. The absolute score and changes in rTNSS and physician-assessed overall nasal signs and symptoms severity were positively correlated. Ciclesonide spray was more effective than levocetirizine in reducing nasal symptoms in both seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis patients. Ciclesonide and levocetrizine were well tolerated alone and in combination.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Our results provide support for an AR and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) recommendation stipulating that ciclesonide is superior to levocetirizine for the treatment of AR, with tolerable safety. Addition of levocetirizine to ciclesonide did not give further clinical benefit over monotherapy.

A multifaceted strategy may offer an effective knowledge translation (knowledge translation) intervention to promote knowledge uptake and improve adherence in an effective walking program based on the Ottawa Panel Evidence Based Clinical Practice Guidelines among individuals with moderate osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A single-blind, randomized control trial was conducted. Patients with mild to moderate (osteoarthritis) of the knee (n=222) were randomized to one of three knowledge translation groups: 1) Walking and Behavioural intervention (Walking and Behavioural intervention) (18 males, 57 females) which included the supervised community-based aerobic walking program combined with a behavioural intervention and an educational pamphlet on the benefits of walking for osteoarthritis; 2) Walking intervention (W) (24 males, 57 females) wherein participants only received the supervised community-based aerobic walking program intervention and the educational pamphlet; 3) Self-directed control (control) (32 males, 52 females) wherein participants only received the educational pamphlet. One-way analyses of variance were used to test for differences in quality of life, adherence, confidence, and clinical outcomes among the study groups at each 3 month assessment during the 12-month intervention period and 6-month follow-up period.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Short-term program adherence was greater in Walking and Behavioural intervention compared to control (p<0.012) after 3 months. The three knowledge translation strategies demonstrated equivalent long-term results for the implementation of a walking program for older individuals with moderate osteoarthritis. Lower dropout rates as well as higher retention rates were observed for Walking and Behavioural intervention at 12 and 18 months.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The additional knowledge translation behavioural component facilitated the implementation of clinical practice guidelines on walking over a short-term period. More studies are needed to improve the long-term walking adherence or longer guidelines uptake on walking among participants with osteoarthritis. Particular attention should be taken into account related to patient's characteristic and preference. osteoarthritis can be managed through the implementation of a walking program based on clinical practice guidelines in existing community-based walking clubs as well as at home with the minimal support of an exercise therapist or a trained volunteer.

TITLE: The effect of written material and verbal method education on anxiety and depression in patients with myocardial infarction in selected hospitals in Iran    ABSTRACT.   Introduction: Myocardial infarction (Myocardial infarction) is the damage to the heart muscle, or myocardium, resulting from the lack of blood flow to the heart. Myocardial infarction patients experience mental and emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. These complications could cause delay in resuming work, decreased quality of life and increased risk of death. The role of education in facilitating adaptation is very important in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of written material and verbal method education on anxiety and depression in patients with myocardial infarction in Urmia hospital in 2009.     Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study, comparing the effect of education on anxiety and depression in patients with myocardial infarction in hospitals affiliated to Urmia University of Medical Science. 124 patients were selected randomly and divided into two groups. The experimental group was educated through face to face training and an educational booklet (Written Material and Verbal Method). The control group did not receive any intervention. The level of anxiety and depression was evaluated, using HADS questionnaire at 3 intervals: after 48 hours of admission, the discharge day and 2 months after discharge.     Results: The findings suggested that Myocardial infarction patients were worried about their social role, interpersonal relations and personal health. Such problems can aggravate symptoms and complicate the future care. Conclusion: Considering the beneficial results obtained from written materials and verbal method education on reducing anxiety and depression in cases with myocardial infarction, this may be one of the health care goals. More research on more patients is required to achieve more conclusive results.

2	5579675	2 g of Yerba Maté	Combining Yerba Maté intake with prolonged exercise at targeted "fat-loss"' intensities augments fatty acid oxidation and improves measures of satiety and mood state. TITLE: Yerba Maté (    ABSTRACT.  Yerba Maté (Yerba Maté), has become a popular herb ingested for enhancing metabolic health and weight-loss outcomes. No studies have tested the combined metabolic, satiety, and psychomotor effects of Yerba Maté during exercise. We tested whether Yerba Maté ingestion affects fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid oxidation), profile of mood state score (profile of mood state score), and subjective appetite scale (VAS), during prolonged moderate exercise. Twelve healthy active females were randomized to ingest either 2 g of Yerba Maté or placebo (placebo) in a repeated-measures design. Participants rested for 120 min before performing a 30-min cycling exercise corresponding to individuals' crossover point intensity (crossover point intensity). fatty acid oxidation, determined using indirect calorimetry, was significantly higher during the 30-min exercise in Yerba Maté vs. placebo (0.21 ± 0.07 vs. 0.17 ± 0.06 g/min, p < 0.05). VAS scores for hunger, prospective eating, and desire to eat were all reduced (p < 0.05). Whereas, profile of mood state score measures of focus, energy, and concentration were all increased (p < 0.05). There was no significant time-effect for any of the measured variables, nor was there any interaction effects between Yerba Maté treatment and time. Such positive combined metabolic, satiety, and psychomotor effects may provide an important role for designing future fat and weight-loss lifestyle interventions.

We tested whether Yerba Maté ingestion affects fatty acid oxidation (fatty acid oxidation), profile of mood state score (profile of mood state score), and subjective appetite scale (VAS), during prolonged moderate exercise. Twelve healthy active females were randomized to ingest either 2 g of Yerba Maté or placebo (placebo) in a repeated-measures design. Participants rested for 120 min before performing a 30-min cycling exercise corresponding to individuals' crossover point intensity (crossover point intensity). fatty acid oxidation, determined using indirect calorimetry, was significantly higher during the 30-min exercise in Yerba Maté vs. placebo (0.21 ± 0.07 vs. 0.17 ± 0.06 g/min, p < 0.05). VAS scores for hunger, prospective eating, and desire to eat were all reduced (p < 0.05). Whereas, profile of mood state score measures of focus, energy, and concentration were all increased (p < 0.05). There was no significant time-effect for any of the measured variables, nor was there any interaction effects between Yerba Maté treatment and time. Such positive combined metabolic, satiety, and psychomotor effects may provide an important role for designing future fat and weight-loss lifestyle interventions.

TITLE: The effect of perineal massage during the second stage of birth on nulliparous women perineal: A randomization clinical trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Childbirth and puerperium are of the most important periods in women's lives and can affect different aspects of their lives.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To determine the effect of perineal massage in the second stage of labor on perineal lacerations, episiotomy, and perineal pain in nulliparous women.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This randomization clinical trial was conducted at Be'sat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran, from 2013 to 2014. A total of 195 nulliparous women were included in the study. The participants were selected through convenience sampling, and randomly assigned to two groups: intervention and control groups. The intervention group received 30-minute perineal massage during second stage of labor. Subsequently, we analyzed perineal laceration, episiotomy, and perineal pain among the two groups. All of them were taught about postpartum perineal pain and its severity, and the researcher followed them up 3 days, 10 days, and 3 months after childbirth by telephone. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18. We used descriptive statistics and analytical statistics, including t test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's test.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The results revealed 23.16% of first-degree perineal laceration and 2.11% of second-degree perineal laceration in the intervention group, and no vestibular laceration or third- and fourth-degree lacerations in the intervention group. However, there were 5.13% of vestibular laceration, 7.69% of first-degree laceration, 2.56% of second-degree laceration, and 1.05% of third-degree laceration (one woman) in the control group. Based on the results, the postpartum perineal pain was significantly different in both groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Regarding the results of this study and those of other studies, perineal massage during the second stage of labor can reduce the need to episiotomy, perineal injuries, and perineal pain.

2	4221328	Propofol	None of the patients developed an acute kidney injury during the study and no significant differences were found between the serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels of the groups during the perioperative period.   TITLE: General anesthesia type does not influence serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in video laparoscopic bariatric surgery    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:.  Video laparoscopic bariatric surgery is the preferred surgical technique for treating morbid obesity. However, pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow. Furthermore, as in other surgical procedures, laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury, as well as of the inflammatory response. Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane, on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Sixty-four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia (propofol) or inhalation anesthesia (sevoflurane). In the perioperative period, blood samples were collected at three time points (before anesthesia, 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum) and urine output was measured for 24 hours. Acute kidney injuries were evaluated by examining both the clinical and laboratory parameters during the postoperative period. The differences between the groups were compared using non-parametric tests. ReBEC (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/recruiting/): RBR-8wt2fy  ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The choice of anesthetic drug, either propofol or sevoflurane, did not affect the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

However, pneumoperitoneum can pose risks to the kidneys by causing a decrease in renal blood flow. Furthermore, as in other surgical procedures, laparoscopic bariatric surgery triggers an acute inflammatory response. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin is an early and accurate biomarker of renal injury, as well as of the inflammatory response. Anesthetic drugs could offer some protection for the kidneys and could attenuate the acute inflammatory response from surgical trauma. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of two types of anesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane, on the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Sixty-four patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized into two anesthesia groups and were administered either total intravenous anesthesia (propofol) or inhalation anesthesia (sevoflurane). In the perioperative period, blood samples were collected at three time points (before anesthesia, 6 hours after pneumoperitoneum and 24 hours after pneumoperitoneum) and urine output was measured for 24 hours. Acute kidney injuries were evaluated by examining both the clinical and laboratory parameters during the postoperative period. The differences between the groups were compared using non-parametric tests. ReBEC (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/recruiting/): RBR-8wt2fy  ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The choice of anesthetic drug, either propofol or sevoflurane, did not affect the serum levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin during the perioperative period in laparoscopic bariatric surgery.

Post treatment pain and mandibular opening showed significantly more improvement in the glucosamine treated patients (P < 0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). TITLE: Evaluation of Glucosamine sulfate and Ibuprofen effects in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis symptom    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  Ibuprofen – a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)- and glucosamine sulfate – a natural compound and a food supplement- are two therapeutic agents which have been widely used for treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint (temporomandibular joint) disorders. This study was aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of these two medications in the treatment of patients suffering from temporomandibular joint disorders.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  After obtaining informed consent, 60 patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Patients with painful temporomandibular joint, temporomandibular joint crepitation or limitation of mouth opening entered the study. Exclusion criteria were history of depressive disorders, cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, asthma, gastrointestinal problems, kidney or liver dysfunction or diabetes mellitus, dental diseases needing ongoing treatment; taking aspirin or warfarin, or concomitant treatment of temporomandibular joint disorder with other agents or methods. Thirty patients were treated with ibuprofen 400 mg twice a day, (mean age 27.12 ± 10.83 years) and 30 patients (mean age 26.60 ± 10) were treated with glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg daily. Patients were visited 30, 60 and 90 days after starting the treatment, pain and mandibular opening were checked and compared within and between two groups.   ABSTRACT.FINDINGS:.  Rate of adverse events was significantly lower in the P value glucosamine sulfate group (P < 0.0001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  This investigation demonstrated that comparing with a commonly prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – ibuprofen-, glucosamine sulfate is a more effective and safer therapeutic agent for treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint degenerative join disorder.

2	3386590	bihevioral variables	None of the measured behavioral and cognitive variables were significantly associated with recall of screening examination results or whether follow-up was as advised. TITLE: Patient Follow-Up After Participating in a Beach-Based Skin Cancer Screening Program    ABSTRACT.  Many skin cancer screenings occur in non-traditional community settings, with the beach being an important setting due to beachgoers being at high risk for skin cancer. This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial of a skin cancer intervention in which participants (n = 312) had a full-body skin examination by a clinician and received a presumptive diagnosis (abnormal finding, no abnormal finding). Participants' pursuit of follow-up was assessed post-intervention (n = 283). Analyses examined: (1) participant's recall of screening results; and (2) whether cognitive and behavioral variables were associated with follow-up being as advised. Just 12% of participants (36/312) did not correctly recall the results of their skin examination. One-third (33%, 93/283) of participants' follow-up was classified as being not as advised (recommend follow-up not pursued, unadvised follow-up pursued). Among participants whose follow-up was not as advised, 71% (66/93) did not seek recommended care. Research is needed to determine what factors are associated with follow-up being as advised and to develop messages that increase receipt of advised follow-up care.

2	5771358	Lidocaine	The mean onset of tourniquet pain in the two groups was not significantly different (P=0.443). TITLE: Analgesic effects of lidocaine-ketorolac compared to lidocaine alone for intravenous regional anesthesia    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Intravenous regional anesthesia is a simple and reliable method for upper extremity surgery. In order to increase the quality of blocks and reduce the amount of pain, many drugs are used with lidocaine. In this study, the effect of ketorolac-lidocaine in intravenous regional anesthesia was investigated.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  40 patients undergoing elective upper limb with America Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II were selected and randomly divided into two groups. The first group of 20 patients received 200 mg of lidocaine, and the second group, 200 mg of lidocaine with 20 mg of ketorolac. In both groups, the drug was diluted to 40 ml. In both groups, the onset of sensory block, onset of tourniquet pain, the onset of pain after opening the tourniquet, score of postoperative pain and analgesic prescription in the first 24 hours, during 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours were studied. A measure of the quality of analgesia was evaluated by VAS.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  In the ketorolac group, the onset of pain after opening the tourniquet was significantly longer than lidocaine group (p<0.001). The mean postoperative pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery in the ketorolac group was significantly lower than lidocaine group (p<0.001). The average number of analgesia prescription during the 24 hours after operation was significantly lower in ketorolac group than lidocaine group (p<0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Adding ketorolac to lidocaine for regional anesthesia can reduce the postoperative pain for up to 24 hours after opening the tourniquet.

TITLE: Analgesic effects of lidocaine-ketorolac compared to lidocaine alone for intravenous regional anesthesia    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Intravenous regional anesthesia is a simple and reliable method for upper extremity surgery. In order to increase the quality of blocks and reduce the amount of pain, many drugs are used with lidocaine. In this study, the effect of ketorolac-lidocaine in intravenous regional anesthesia was investigated.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  40 patients undergoing elective upper limb with America Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II were selected and randomly divided into two groups. The first group of 20 patients received 200 mg of lidocaine, and the second group, 200 mg of lidocaine with 20 mg of ketorolac. In both groups, the drug was diluted to 40 ml. In both groups, the onset of sensory block, onset of tourniquet pain, the onset of pain after opening the tourniquet, score of postoperative pain and analgesic prescription in the first 24 hours, during 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours were studied. A measure of the quality of analgesia was evaluated by VAS.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The mean onset of tourniquet pain in the two groups was not significantly different (P=0.443). In the ketorolac group, the onset of pain after opening the tourniquet was significantly longer than lidocaine group (p<0.001). The average number of analgesia prescription during the 24 hours after operation was significantly lower in ketorolac group than lidocaine group (p<0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Adding ketorolac to lidocaine for regional anesthesia can reduce the postoperative pain for up to 24 hours after opening the tourniquet.

TITLE: A randomized phase     ABSTRACT.  Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (advanced biliary tract cancer) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed. In the current study, we conducted an open‐label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (cyclophosphamide) could improve antigen‐specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (personalized peptide vaccination) in 49 previously treated advanced biliary tract cancer patients. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive personalized peptide vaccination with low dose cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or personalized peptide vaccination alone (n = 25). A maximum of four HLA‐matched peptides were selected based on the pre‐existing peptide‐specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration. T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the personalized peptide vaccination alone arm. The personalized peptide vaccination alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL‐6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen‐specific T cell responses. These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose cyclophosphamide could provide clinical benefits in advanced biliary tract cancer patients under personalized peptide vaccination, possibly through prevention of IL‐6‐mediated immune suppression. Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.

2	3893439	Environmental enrichment	Our results showed that environmental enrichment: (1) decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and enhanced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after mild TBI; (2) mitigated mTBI-induced cognitive impairment; and (3) attenuated mTBI-induced downregulation in pAMPK/AMPK ratio and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase levels.   TITLE: Decreased neuroinflammation and increased brain energy homeostasis following environmental enrichment after mild traumatic brain injury is associated with improvement in cognitive function    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Persistent neuroinflammation and disruptions in brain energy metabolism is commonly seen in traumatic brain injury (traumatic brain injury). Because of the lack of success of most traumatic brain injury interventions and the documented benefits of environmental enrichment (environmental enrichment) in enhancing brain plasticity, here we focused our study on use of environmental enrichment in regulating injury-induced neuroinflammation and disruptions in energy metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats were used in the study and randomly assigned to receive either: mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) using the controlled cortical injury model or sham surgery. Following surgery, rats from each group were further randomized to either: environmental enrichment housing or standard laboratory housing (CON). After 4 weeks of recovery, cognitive testing was performed using the non-matching-to-sample and delayed non-matching-to-sample tasks. After completion of behavioral testing, levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured. In addition, levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) were assessed as measures of brain energy homeostasis.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Our data demonstrated the potential of environmental enrichment to modulate the persistent: (1) neuroinflammatory response seen following mild TBI, and (2) persistent disturbance in brain energy homeostasis. It is possible that through the mechanism of modulating neuroinflammation, environmental enrichment housing was able to restore the disruption in energy metabolism and enhanced functional recovery after mild TBI.

2	4495314	Extended postpartum care (Intervention group, intervention group)	intervention group mothers used significantly more midwife contacts than control group mothers. TITLE: Early Detection of Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in Mothers and Fathers and Its Relation to Midwives’ Evaluation and Service Provision: A Community-Based Study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Postpartum parental mental health problems pose a serious risk for child development and often remain undetected in postpartum primary care. Within the framework of the German Midwifes Prevention Study, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of postpartum emotional distress in mothers and fathers, and the detection of distressed parents by midwives in a primary care setting. We also examined whether a temporal extension of the postpartum midwife care period is associated with greater use of midwife contacts and higher rates of referral to further professional support if needed.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Mothers, fathers, and midwives filled out questionnaires at 2 weeks (t1) and 6 months (t2) postpartum. Compared to standard care in the control group (control group), midwives in an intervention group (intervention group) offered extended postpartum care of 6 months postpartum. Parental psychological distress was assessed using the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (Edinburgh postnatal depression scale). Midwives reported on parental psychological distress as well as the number of postpartum contacts and referrals to additional social- and health-care providers.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Based on their ratings, midwives identified half of mothers and around one-quarter of fathers with elevated depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale at t1 and t2. intervention group mothers with high-postnatal psychological distress at t2 used significantly more contacts than mothers with lower levels of distress. intervention group mothers with high-psychological distress at t2 were referred to additional support services more often than mothers with lower levels of distress.

We also examined whether a temporal extension of the postpartum midwife care period is associated with greater use of midwife contacts and higher rates of referral to further professional support if needed.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Mothers, fathers, and midwives filled out questionnaires at 2 weeks (t1) and 6 months (t2) postpartum. Compared to standard care in the control group (control group), midwives in an intervention group (intervention group) offered extended postpartum care of 6 months postpartum. Parental psychological distress was assessed using the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (Edinburgh postnatal depression scale). Midwives reported on parental psychological distress as well as the number of postpartum contacts and referrals to additional social- and health-care providers.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Based on their ratings, midwives identified half of mothers and around one-quarter of fathers with elevated depressive symptoms according to the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale at t1 and t2. intervention group mothers with high-postnatal psychological distress at t2 used significantly more contacts than mothers with lower levels of distress. intervention group mothers with high-psychological distress at t2 were referred to additional support services more often than mothers with lower levels of distress.
2	3800406	group II used chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 1.5%	Group II showed significantly less stain intensity in comparison with group I after 14 and 21 days (P values 0.025 and 0.005, respectively). TITLE: Effect of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash as an adjunct to chlorhexidine on stains and plaque    ABSTRACT.AIM:.  To investigate whether the use of an oxidizing mouth rinse as an adjunct to chlorhexidine is efficacious in reducing stains and plaque.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  This study had a single-blind, three-group (n = 35 each) parallel design, including a 21 days experimental period during which group I rinsed with chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine) 0.2% alone, group II used chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 1.5%. Group III rinsed with the same mouthwashes in reverse order. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The examination for plaque, and stains was done after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of rinsing.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The proportion of stained surfaces was less in the group II than in the group I and was significant at the end of 1 week. The plaque formation was significantly less in groups II and III than group I at 7, 14, and 21 days.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The adjunctive use of hydrogen peroxide to chlorhexidine proved to be superior to chlorhexidine alone with regard to the inhibition of plaque and development of stains.

TITLE: Standardizing the Protocols for Enhanced Recovery From Colorectal Cancer Surgery: Are We a Step Closer to Ideal Recovery?     ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  Enhanced recovery protocols are being implemented into the standard of care in surgical practice. This study aimed to insert a steadfast set of elements into the perioperative care pathway to establish an improved recovery program for colorectal cancer patients.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Seventy patients planned for elective laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized into 2 groups: conventional recovery group (n = 35) and enhanced recovery group (n = 35). The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included the times of removal of nasogastric tubes (nasogastric tubes), successful enteral feeding, and removal of drains, postoperative complications, intra-hospital mortality, and rate of readmission.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Complications were significantly lower among patients in the enhanced group (25.7% vs. 65.7%) (P = 0.001). The rates of readmission were similar in the 2 groups.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Applying definite evidence-based elements to the colorectal rehabilitation program significantly boosts the recovery pathway with favorable outcomes, including faster recovery of gastrointestinal tract functions, lower morbidities, and eventually earlier discharge from the hospital.

2	4354356	Heroin	Relative to the placebo treatment in patients, heroin significantly increased resting-state functional connectivity of the left putamen within the basal ganglia/limbic network, the extent of which correlated positively with patients' feelings of rush and with the plasma level of morphine. TITLE: Increased functional connectivity in the resting-state basal ganglia network after acute heroin substitution    ABSTRACT.  Reinforcement signals in the striatum are known to be crucial for mediating the subjective rewarding effects of acute drug intake. It is proposed that these effects may be more involved in early phases of drug addiction, whereas negative reinforcement effects may occur more in later stages of the illness. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether acute heroin substitution also induced positive reinforcement effects in striatal brain regions of protracted heroin-maintained patients. Using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach, we compared resting-state functional connectivity (resting-state functional connectivity) strengths within the basal ganglia/limbic network across a group of heroin-dependent patients receiving both an acute infusion of heroin and placebo and 20 healthy subjects who received placebo only. Subsequent correlation analyses were performed to test whether the resting-state functional connectivity strength under heroin exposure correlated with the subjective rewarding effect and with plasma concentrations of heroin and its main metabolites morphine. Furthermore, healthy controls revealed increased resting-state functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in this network relative to the placebo treatment in patients. Our results indicate that acute heroin substitution induces a subjective rewarding effect via increased striatal connectivity in heroin-dependent patients, suggesting that positive reinforcement effects in the striatum still occur after protracted maintenance therapy.

TITLE: To condition or not condition? Analysing ‘change’ in longitudinal randomised controlled trials    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The statistical analysis for a 2-arm randomised controlled trial (randomised controlled trial) with a baseline outcome followed by a few assessments at fixed follow-up times typically invokes traditional analytic methods (eg, analysis of covariance (analysis of covariance), longitudinal data analysis (longitudinal data analysis)). ' Constrained' longitudinal data analysis ('Constrained' longitudinal data analysis) is a well-established unconditional technique that constrains means of baseline to be equal between arms. We use an analysis of fasting lipid profiles from the Group Medical Clinics (Group Medical Clinics) longitudinal randomised controlled trial on patients with diabetes to illustrate applications of analysis of covariance, longitudinal data analysis and 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis to demonstrate theoretical concepts of these methods including the impact of missing data.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  For the analysis of the illustrated example, all models were fit using linear mixed models to participants with only complete data and to participants using all available data.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.

We use an analysis of fasting lipid profiles from the Group Medical Clinics (Group Medical Clinics) longitudinal randomised controlled trial on patients with diabetes to illustrate applications of analysis of covariance, longitudinal data analysis and 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis to demonstrate theoretical concepts of these methods including the impact of missing data.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  For the analysis of the illustrated example, all models were fit using linear mixed models to participants with only complete data and to participants using all available data.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  With all available data (n=233), applying the 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis model yielded an low-density lipoprotein improvement of 8.9 mg/dL (95% CI −16.7 to −1.0; p=0.03) for Group Medical Clinics compared with usual care. The less efficient, longitudinal data analysis analysis yielded an low-density lipoprotein improvement of 7.2 mg/dL (95% CI −17.2 to 2.8; p=0.15) for Group Medical Clinics compared with usual care.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Under reasonable missing data assumptions, 'Constrained' longitudinal data analysis will yield efficient treatment effect estimates and robust inferential statistics. It may be regarded as the method of choice over analysis of covariance and longitudinal data analysis.

2	5018157	Low-dose bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in pre-eclamptic parturients	The one-minute Apgar score was significantly lower for the preeclamptic parturients (8.4 ± 0.7 versus 7.2 ± 1.5) (P = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in the five-minute Apgar scores between the two groups.   TITLE: Comparing the Hemodynamic Effects of Spinal Anesthesia in Preeclamptic and Healthy Parturients During Cesarean Section    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Despite controversies about the safest anesthetic technique for cesarean delivery in severely preeclamptic women, there is evidence that supports the use of spinal anesthesia in this group of patients.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  This prospective randomized clinical trial was designed to determine the hemodynamic effects of low-dose spinal bupivacaine and the incidence of spinal anesthesia-associated hypotension in severely preeclamptic and healthy parturients undergoing cesarean sections.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  Spinal anesthesia was performed with 10 mg (= 2 mL) hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine plus 2.5 μg sufentanil in two groups of patients after they received 500 mL of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before spinal anesthesia and at two minutes intervals for 15 minutes after the block, and then every five minutes until the end of the surgery. Hypotension was defined as more than 25% of decline in the mean arterial blood pressure compared to the baseline in both groups (or systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg in healthy parturients) and was treated with 5 mg IV ephedrine. The total amounts of intravenous administered fluid and the total doses of ephedrine were recorded for each patient as well.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The incidence rate of hypotension among the preeclamptic patients was lower than that of the healthy parturients, despite the former group receiving smaller volumes of intravenous fluids (P < 0.05). The total doses of IV ephedrine for treating hypotension were significantly lower among the preeclamptic patients (3.2 mg in preeclamptic patients versus 7.6 mg in normotensive patients) (P = 0.02). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Our results confirm that low-dose bupivacaine spinal anesthesia is associated with a lower risk of hypotension than previously believed, and it can therefore be safely used in severe preeclamptic women undergoing cesarean delivery.

TITLE: α-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone Treatment in Pigs Does Not Improve Early Graft Function in Kidney Transplants from Brain Dead Donors    ABSTRACT.  Delayed graft function and primary non-function are serious complications following transplantation of kidneys derived from deceased brain dead (deceased brain dead) donors. α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide and its renoprotective effects have been demonstrated in models of acute kidney injury. We hypothesized that α-MSH treatment of the recipient improves early graft function and reduces inflammation following deceased brain dead kidney transplantation. Eight Danish landrace pigs served as deceased brain dead donors. After four hours of brain death both kidneys were removed and stored for 18 hours at 4°C in Custodiol preservation solution. Sixteen recipients were randomized in a paired design into two treatment groups, transplanted simultaneously. α-MSH or a vehicle was administered at start of surgery, during reperfusion and two hours post-reperfusion. The recipients were observed for ten hours following reperfusion. Blood, urine and kidney tissue samples were collected during and at the end of follow-up. α-MSH treatment reduced urine flow and impaired recovery of glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) compared to controls. After each dose of α-MSH, a trend towards reduced mean arterial blood pressure and increased heart rate was observed. α-MSH did not affect expression of inflammatory markers. Surprisingly, α-MSH impaired recovery of renal function in the first ten hours following deceased brain dead kidney transplantation possibly due to hemodynamic changes.

TITLE: α-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone Treatment in Pigs Does Not Improve Early Graft Function in Kidney Transplants from Brain Dead Donors    ABSTRACT.  Delayed graft function and primary non-function are serious complications following transplantation of kidneys derived from deceased brain dead (deceased brain dead) donors. α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide and its renoprotective effects have been demonstrated in models of acute kidney injury. We hypothesized that α-MSH treatment of the recipient improves early graft function and reduces inflammation following deceased brain dead kidney transplantation. Eight Danish landrace pigs served as deceased brain dead donors. After four hours of brain death both kidneys were removed and stored for 18 hours at 4°C in Custodiol preservation solution. Sixteen recipients were randomized in a paired design into two treatment groups, transplanted simultaneously. α-MSH or a vehicle was administered at start of surgery, during reperfusion and two hours post-reperfusion. The recipients were observed for ten hours following reperfusion. Blood, urine and kidney tissue samples were collected during and at the end of follow-up. α-MSH treatment reduced urine flow and impaired recovery of glomerular filtration rate (glomerular filtration rate) compared to controls. After each dose of α-MSH, a trend towards reduced mean arterial blood pressure and increased heart rate was observed. Surprisingly, α-MSH impaired recovery of renal function in the first ten hours following deceased brain dead kidney transplantation possibly due to hemodynamic changes. Thus, in a porcine experimental model α-MSH did not reduce renal inflammation and did not improve short-term graft function following deceased brain dead kidney transplantation.

TITLE: Long-term effect of lifestyle intervention on adiposity, metabolic parameters, inflammation and physical fitness in obese children: a randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Behavioral lifestyle intervention, combined with parental involvement, is preferred over standard care or self-help in childhood obesity. The short-term results of such interventions are promising, but long-term follow-up results are equivocal.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  The objective of the present study was the short (3 months) and long-term (1 and 2 years follow-up) effect evaluation of a family-based multidisciplinary cognitive behavioral lifestyle intervention on markers of adiposity, metabolism, inflammation and physical fitness compared with standard care in children with obesity. Also the association between these outcome variables was determined.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  In this prospective longitudinal clinical trial, obese children were randomly assigned to a 3-month family-based cognitive behavioral multidisciplinary lifestyle treatment (n=40; body mass index-standard deviation score (body mass index-standard deviation score) 4.2±0.7; age; 13.3±2.0 years) or to a control group receiving an initial advice on physical activity and nutrition (n=39; body mass index-standard deviation score 4.3±0.6; age 13.1±1.9 years). Anthropometric data, physical fitness, metabolic parameters and inflammatory state were evaluated at baseline, after intervention (at 3 months) and at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, anthropometric data and physical fitness were measured in the intervention group.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  No significant intervention effect was found for serum lipid profile, high-sensitive C-reactive protein or for adiponectin. At 2-year follow-up, body mass index-standard deviation score in the intervention group (n=31) was 3.8±1.2 SDS, significantly less than at baseline (P=0.02).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  A positive 1-year follow-up treatment effect was found for adiposity, physical fitness and glucose homeostasis, but not for inflammatory markers. There was a significant long-term treatment effect on adiposity, although almost all children remained obese.

The experimental group (n=10) received Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training and general rehabilitation therapy. The control group (n=9) received a home program as well as general rehabilitation therapy. Both groups received 30 sessions of Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training or home program training for 60 minutes per session 3 times a week during the 10-week period. The reaching movements were captured by a motion analysis system. Kinematic variables including movement time (movement time), mean velocity (mean velocity), normalized jerk score (normalized jerk score), mean angular velocity (mean angular velocity) and normalized jerk score of the shoulder, elbow and wrist joint with comfortable and fast speed were analyzed between groups and the pre-post training group.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  However, After pre- and post-training control group, mean velocity improved significantlyin reaching movement of only comfortable speed (p<0.05). Between two groups, movement time and mean angular velocity of the elbow at comfortable speed and normalized jerk score of the elbow at fast speed were statisticallysignificant (p<0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Comprehensive Hand Repetitive Intensive Strength Training proved to be an effective intervention for improving upper limb extremity function of reaching movement in children with cerebral palsy.

2	4842387	BrainPower Advanced capsules	BrainPower Advanced intervention, however, improved a greater proportion of the severe Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss (29.5%)(13/44) (P < 0.01) and SAD (34.9%)(15/43)(P < 0.01) than placebo (5.1% (2/39) and 13.5% (5/37), resp.). TITLE: The Relieving Effects of BrainPower Advanced, a Dietary Supplement, in Older Adults with Subjective Memory Complaints: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.  Subjective memory complaints (Subjective memory complaints) are common in older adults that can often predict further cognitive impairment. No proven effective agents are available for Subjective memory complaints. The effect of BrainPower Advanced, a dietary supplement consisting of herbal extracts, nutrients, and vitamins, was evaluated in 98 volunteers with Subjective memory complaints, averaging 67 years of age (47–88), in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss (Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss) and attention/concentration deficits (SAD) were evaluated before and after 12-week supplementation of BrainPower Advanced capsules (n = 47) or placebo (n = 51), using a 5-point memory questionnaire (1 = no/slight, 5 = severe). Objective memory function was evaluated using 3 subtests of visual/audio memory, abstraction, and memory recall that gave a combined total score. The BrainPower Advanced group had more cases of severe Subjective hypomnesis/memory loss (severity ⩾ 3) (44/47) and severe SAD (43/47) than the placebo group (39/51 and 37/51, < 0.05, < 0.05, resp.) before the treatment. Thus, 3-month BrainPower Advanced supplementation appears to be beneficial to older adults with Subjective memory complaints.

TITLE: Absolute position versus relative position in embryo transfer: a randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Meta-analysis revealed that embryo placement 20 mm from the fundal endometrial surface resulted in higher pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate compared with placement 10 mm from the fundal endometrial surface. Pregnancy and implantation rates according to relative position were higher when the catheter tip was positioned close to the middle of the endometrial cavity. The aim of the current study is to evaluate differences in implantation and pregnancy rates if the site of embryo transfer is 2 cm distance from the fundal endometrium (distance from the fundal endometrium) compared to the midpoint of the endometrial cavity length (endometrial cavity length).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients were randomized to one of two groups: in group A (n = 98, 98 IVF-ET cycles), the embryo transfer catheter tip was positioned 2 cm distance from the fundal endometrium, while that in group B (n = 97, 97 IVF-ET cycles) was positioned at the midpoint of the endometrial cavity length. We compared pregnancy outcomes of implantation rate, chemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, and miscarriage rate in the two groups.

TITLE: Comparison of Clinical Efficacy of Newfactan® versus Surfacten® for the Treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome in the Newborn Infants    ABSTRACT.  Newfactan® is a domestically developed, bovine lung-derived, semi-synthetic surfactant. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of Newfactan® with that of Surfacten® in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (respiratory distress syndrome). Newfactan® or Surfacten® was randomly allocated to 492 newborn infants who were diagnosed as respiratory distress syndrome and required surfactant instillation in four participating hospitals. The comparisons were made individually in two subsets of infants by birth weight (<1,500 g group [n=253] and ≥1,500 g group [n=239]). Short-term responses to surfactant and acute complications, such as the total doses of surfactant instilled, response type, extubation rate, ventilator settings, changes in respiratory parameters, air leak, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality during the 96 hr after surfactant instillation were measured. Long-term outcome and complications, such as total duration of intubation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and periventricular leukomalacia, and ultimate mortality were measured. There were no significant differences in demographic and perinatal variables, short-term responses to surfactant and acute complications, and long-term outcome and complications between Newfactan® and Surfacten® in both birth weight groups.

2	4262215	mental clinical nursing pathway care	For individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life. TITLE: The interference in the suicide ideation of patients with malignant tumors by mental clinical nursing pathway    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mental clinical nursing pathways on suicidal ideation and life quality of patients with malignant tumors.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Two hundred patients with malignant tumors were randomly divided into a study group and a control group, with 100 patients in each group. During the treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of medical orders. Thereafter, the "self-rating idea of suicide scale" and Karnofsky Performance Status (Karnofsky Performance Status) were used to compare the differences in the suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups before and after the treatment.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  There were no statistical differences in the scores of despair factor, optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor between the two groups before the treatment (P>0.05). After different styles of nursing, the former four factors of patients in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the score of cover factor between the two groups (P>0.05). The Karnofsky Performance Status of patients receiving mental clinical nursing pathway care was higher than those receiving usual nursing care, and there was a statistical significant difference between the two groups (P<0.01). Interestingly, the patients' suicidal ideation scale was negatively correlated with Karnofsky Performance Status (r =−0.29, P<0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION. 
1	4262215	usual nursing care	For individuals diagnosed with a malignant tumor, using a mental health clinical nursing pathway can effectively decrease the degree of suicidal ideation and positively impact the quality of life. TITLE: The interference in the suicide ideation of patients with malignant tumors by mental clinical nursing pathway    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of mental clinical nursing pathways on suicidal ideation and life quality of patients with malignant tumors.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Two hundred patients with malignant tumors were randomly divided into a study group and a control group, with 100 patients in each group. During the treatment, patients in the study group received mental clinical nursing pathway care, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse's reactions to patient's behavior, and execution of medical orders. Thereafter, the "self-rating idea of suicide scale" and Karnofsky Performance Status (Karnofsky Performance Status) were used to compare the differences in the suicidal ideation of patients with malignant tumors between the two groups before and after the treatment.

2	5491162	Standard treatment plus Mizoribine	No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.   TITLE: Efficacy and safety of adding mizoribine to standard treatment in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy: A randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Mizoribine (Mizoribine) is an immunosuppressive drug used in Japan for treating patients with lupus nephritis and nephrotic syndrome and has been also reportedly effective in patients with immunoglobulin A (immunoglobulin A) nephropathy. However, to date, few randomized control studies of Mizoribine are performed in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Therefore, this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding Mizoribine to standard treatment in these patients, and was conducted between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2016, as a multicenter study.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receiving standard treatment plus Mizoribine (Mizoribine group) or standard treatment (control group). Mizoribine was administered orally at a dose of 150 mg once daily for 12 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Primary outcomes were the percentage reduction in urinary protein excretion from baseline and the rate of patients with hematuria disappearance 36 months after study initiation. Secondary outcomes were the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission rate, absolute changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, and the change in daily dose of prednisolone. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to Mizoribine (n = 21) and control groups (n = 21). Nine patients in Mizoribine group and 15 patients in the control group completed the study. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The addition of Mizoribine to standard treatment has no beneficial effect on reducing urinary protein excretion and hematuria when treating patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy.

The addition of Mizoribine to standard treatment has no beneficial effect on reducing urinary protein excretion and hematuria when treating patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy.
0	5491162	Standard treatment plus Mizoribine vs. Standard treatment	Secondary outcomes were the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission rate, absolute changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, and the change in daily dose of prednisolone. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to Mizoribine (n = 21) and control groups (n = 21). Nine patients in Mizoribine group and 15 patients in the control group completed the study. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.   TITLE: Efficacy and safety of adding mizoribine to standard treatment in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy: A randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Mizoribine (Mizoribine) is an immunosuppressive drug used in Japan for treating patients with lupus nephritis and nephrotic syndrome and has been also reportedly effective in patients with immunoglobulin A (immunoglobulin A) nephropathy. However, to date, few randomized control studies of Mizoribine are performed in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Therefore, this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding Mizoribine to standard treatment in these patients, and was conducted between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2016, as a multicenter study.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receiving standard treatment plus Mizoribine (Mizoribine group) or standard treatment (control group). Mizoribine was administered orally at a dose of 150 mg once daily for 12 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Primary outcomes were the percentage reduction in urinary protein excretion from baseline and the rate of patients with hematuria disappearance 36 months after study initiation. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The addition of Mizoribine to standard treatment has no beneficial effect on reducing urinary protein excretion and hematuria when treating patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy.
2	5504551	awareness of wearing an accelerometer (nonblinded group)	Our study shows that the awareness of wearing an accelerometer has no influence on physical activity patterns in young people. TITLE: Awareness of wearing an accelerometer does not affect physical activity in youth    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  This study aimed to investigate whether awareness of being monitored by an accelerometer has an effect on physical activity in young people.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Eighty healthy participants aged 10–18 years were randomized between blinded and nonblinded groups. The blinded participants were informed that we were testing the reliability of a new device for body posture assessment and these participants did not receive any information about physical activity. In contrast, the nonblinded participants were informed that the device was an accelerometer that assessed physical activity levels and patterns. The participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer for 4 consecutive days (2 school days and 2 school-free days).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Missing data led to the exclusion of 2 participants assigned to the blinded group. When data from the blinded group were compared with these from the nonblinded group, no differences were found in the duration of any of the following items: (i) wearing the accelerometer, (ii) total physical activity, (iii) sedentary activity, and (iv) moderate-to-vigorous activity.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This study improves the understanding of physical activity assessment and underlines the objectivity of this method.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.

TITLE: Effects of low-dose ketamine on succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia in outpatient surgeries: a randomized, double-blind study    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  Despite the many complications of succinylcholine, it is still widely used as a superior muscle relaxant for rapid sequence induction. One of these complications is postoperative myalgia (postoperative myalgia). The aim of this study was to investigate the prophylactic effect of low-dose ketamine on the incidence and severity of postoperative myalgia.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.  In this double-blind clinical study, a total of 148 patients scheduled for general anesthesia were randomly divided into two equal groups. Initially, in Group K, 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine was injected intravenously, whereas in Group N, the same volume (5 mL) of normal saline was injected. Thereafter, anesthesia was induced in all patients, by injecting 1.5 mg/kg of fentanyl and 2 mg/kg of propofol intravenously. Following the loss of eyelid reflex, 1.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine was injected intravenously as a muscle relaxant and then the patients were intubated. postoperative myalgia was defined as a pain with no surgical interferences, and its intensity was graded based on a four-point scale. The incidence and severity of myalgia were assessed by a blinded observer 24 hours after surgery.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In terms of demographic data, the results of this study showed that there is no significant difference between patients in both groups (P>0.05). After the induction of anesthesia, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were found to reduce in both groups (P<0.05). However, the changes were somehow similar, and repeated measures of variance analysis showed no significant difference in the two study groups (P>0.05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The addition of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine to propofol for the induction of anesthesia can be effective in reducing the incidence of low-grade postoperative myalgia.

TITLE: Comparative Efficacy of Once-Daily Umeclidinium/Vilanterol and Tiotropium/Olodaterol Therapy in Symptomatic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Study    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  We report the results of the first direct comparison of the once-daily fixed-dose long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting β2-agonist (LAMA/LABA) combinations umeclidinium/vilanterol (umeclidinium/vilanterol) and tiotropium/olodaterol (tiotropium/olodaterol) in patients with COPD.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was a randomized, two-period crossover open-label study in symptomatic patients with COPD [age 40 years or older, postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) of 70% or less and 50% or more of predicted normal values, and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of 2 or greater] not receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Patients were randomized to receive umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5/25 μg once daily) via a multidose dry powder inhaler (ELLIPTA) followed by tiotropium/olodaterol (5/5 μg once daily) via a soft mist inhaler (Respimat), each for 8 weeks with an interim 3-week washout or vice versa. The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per-protocol (per-protocol) population. The incidence of adverse events was also assessed.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In total, 236 patients (mean age 64.4 years, 60% male) were included in the intent-to-treat population and 227 were included in the per-protocol population. Patients receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase (100 mL or more) from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at week 8 compared with patients receiving tiotropium/olodaterol (odds ratio 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.34–3.14). Adverse events occurred in 25% of patients in the umeclidinium/vilanterol group and in 31% of patients in the tiotropium/olodaterol group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.

TITLE: Comparative Efficacy of Once-Daily Umeclidinium/Vilanterol and Tiotropium/Olodaterol Therapy in Symptomatic Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Study    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  We report the results of the first direct comparison of the once-daily fixed-dose long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting β2-agonist (LAMA/LABA) combinations umeclidinium/vilanterol (umeclidinium/vilanterol) and tiotropium/olodaterol (tiotropium/olodaterol) in patients with COPD.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was a randomized, two-period crossover open-label study in symptomatic patients with COPD [age 40 years or older, postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) of 70% or less and 50% or more of predicted normal values, and modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score of 2 or greater] not receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Patients were randomized to receive umeclidinium/vilanterol (62.5/25 μg once daily) via a multidose dry powder inhaler (ELLIPTA) followed by tiotropium/olodaterol (5/5 μg once daily) via a soft mist inhaler (Respimat), each for 8 weeks with an interim 3-week washout or vice versa. The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at week 8 with a noninferiority margin of − 50 mL in the per-protocol (per-protocol) population. The incidence of adverse events was also assessed.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  In total, 236 patients (mean age 64.4 years, 60% male) were included in the intent-to-treat population and 227 were included in the per-protocol population. Patients receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase (100 mL or more) from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at week 8 compared with patients receiving tiotropium/olodaterol (odds ratio 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.34–3.14). Adverse events occurred in 25% of patients in the umeclidinium/vilanterol group and in 31% of patients in the tiotropium/olodaterol group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In this first direct comparison of two once-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations, superiority was observed for the primary end point of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s at week 8 with umeclidinium/vilanterol compared with tiotropium/olodaterol in patients with symptomatic COPD.

TITLE: Preoperative conventional chemoradiotherapy versus short-course radiotherapy with delayed surgery for rectal cancer: results of a randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  There still is no evidence which neoadjuvant therapy regimen for stage II–III rectal cancer is superior. The aim of this study was to compare results achieved after long-course chemoradiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) with short-term radiotherapy (radiotherapy) followed by delayed surgery.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A randomized trial was carried out between 2007–2013. One hundred fifty patients diagnosed with stage II–III rectal cancer were randomized into one of two neoadjuvant treatment arms: conventional chemoradiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy) and short-term radiotherapy (radiotherapy) followed by surgery after 6–8 weeks. Primary endpoints of this trial were downstaging and pathological complete response rate. Secondary endpoints were local recurrence rate and overall survival.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Downstaging (stage 0 and I) was observed in 21 (30.9%) cases in radiotherapy group vs. 27 (37.5%) cases in chemoradiotherapy group (P = 0.409). Median follow-up time was 39.7 (range 4.9–79.7) months. 3-years overall survival (overall survival) was 78% in radiotherapy group vs. 82.4% in chemoradiotherapy group (P = 0.145), while disease-free survival (disease-free survival) differed significantly – 59% in radiotherapy group vs. 75.1% in chemoradiotherapy group (P = 0,022).

The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. TITLE: Acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and their combination on facial emotion recognition: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in cannabis users    ABSTRACT.  Acute administration of the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), impairs human facial affect recognition, implicating the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing. Another main constituent of cannabis, cannabidiol (cannabidiol), has seemingly opposite functional effects on the brain. This study aimed to determine the effects of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (8 mg), cannabidiol (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. cannabidiol did not influence feelings of 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, cannabidiol improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.

This study aimed to determine the effects of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, both alone and in combination on emotional facial affect recognition. 48 volunteers, selected for high and low frequency of cannabis use and schizotypy, were administered, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (8 mg), cannabidiol (16 mg), THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) and placebo, by inhalation, in a 4-way, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. They completed an emotional facial affect recognition task including fearful, angry, happy, sad, surprise and disgust faces varying in intensity from 20% to 100%. A visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale) of feeling 'stoned' was also completed. In comparison to placebo, cannabidiol improved emotional facial affect recognition at 60% emotional intensity; Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was detrimental to the recognition of ambiguous faces of 40% intensity. The combination of THC+CBD produced no impairment. Relative to placebo, both Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol alone and combined THC+CBD equally increased feelings of being 'stoned'. No effects of frequency of use or schizotypy were found. In conclusion, cannabidiol improves recognition of emotional facial affect and attenuates the impairment induced by Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. This is the first human study examining the effects of different cannabinoids on emotional processing. It provides preliminary evidence that different pharmacological agents acting upon the endocannabinoid system can both improve and impair recognition of emotional faces.

TITLE: Benefits of different postoperative treatments in patients undergoing knee arthroscopic debridement    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To assess the effectiveness of viscosupplementation or platelet-rich plasma (platelet-rich plasma), compared to standard care, for pain relief after knee arthroscopic debridement in patients with meniscal pathology and osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis), under normal clinical practice conditions.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  We conducted a prospective, randomized, evaluator-blind, pilot study. After arthroscopy, patients were randomized to receive 1) five injections of HA1 (Suprahyal®/Adant®); 2) four injections of HA2 (Orthovisc®); 3) three injections of HA3 (Synvisc®); 4) a single injection of platelet-rich plasma (GPSTM II); or 5) standard care (control). Patients were followed up for 18 months. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Minimally Clinical Important Improvement (Minimally Clinical Important Improvement), as relative improvement ≥20 for pain and function, was also calculated.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Fifty patients were included. At early follow-up (3 months), total WOMAC scores improved in all groups compared to baseline with reductions of 44.79% (HA1), 24.02% (HA2), 40.38% (HA3), 39.77% (platelet-rich plasma), and 27.64% (control) (p=0.002 HA1 compared to HA2). The percentage of patients achieving the Minimally Clinical Important Improvement for both pain and function at 18 months was 100% (HA1), 80% (HA3), 60% (HA2), and 60% (platelet-rich plasma), whereas, in the control group, all patients returned to pre-arthroscopy levels. There were no adverse events attributable to surgery or to intraarticular administration.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Viscosupplementation following arthroscopy is more effective than platelet-rich plasma in adequately selected patients with meniscal lesions occurring concomitantly with osteoarthritis. Further controlled studies with a larger sample size and/or alternative regimens would be of interest for the scientific community.

TITLE: A comparison of clofarabine with ara-C, each in combination with daunorubicin as induction treatment in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia    ABSTRACT.  The study was designed to compare clofarabine plus daunorubicin vs daunorubicin/ara-C in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (acute myeloid leukaemia) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (myelodysplastic syndrome). Eight hundred and six untreated patients in the UK NCRI AML16 trial with AML/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (median age, 67 years; range 56–84) and normal serum creatinine were randomised to two courses of induction chemotherapy with either daunorubicin/ara-C (daunorubicin/ara-C) or daunorubicin/clofarabine (daunorubicin/clofarabine). Patients were also included in additional randomisations; ± one dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in course 1; 2v3 courses and ± azacitidine maintenance. The primary end point was overall survival. There was no difference in 30-/60-day mortality or toxicity: significantly more supportive care was required in the daunorubicin/ara-C arm even though platelet and neutrophil recovery was significantly slower with daunorubicin/clofarabine. There were no differences in cumulative incidence of relapse (74% vs 68% hazard ratio (hazard ratio) 0.93 (0.77–1.14), P=0.5); survival from relapse (7% vs 9% hazard ratio 0.96 (0.77–1.19), P=0.7); relapse-free (31% vs 32% hazard ratio 1.02 (0.83–1.24), P=0.9) or overall survival (23% vs 22% hazard ratio 1.08 (0.93–1.26), P=0.3). Clofarabine 20 mg/m2 given for 5 days with daunorubicin is not superior to ara-C+daunorubicin as induction for older patients with AML/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.

TITLE: A Comparative Study of Two Different Doses of Epidural Neostigmine Coadministered with Lignocaine for Post Operative Analgesia and Sedation    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Adjuvants have been used to prolong analgesic effects of epidural local anaesthetics. We studied two different doses of neostigmine.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS & METHODS:.  A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries. The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine, with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period. Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg-1), succinylcholine (2mg kg-1) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent). There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group. Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.

Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.

TITLE: A Comparative Study of Two Different Doses of Epidural Neostigmine Coadministered with Lignocaine for Post Operative Analgesia and Sedation    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Adjuvants have been used to prolong analgesic effects of epidural local anaesthetics. We studied two different doses of neostigmine.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS & METHODS:.  A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries. The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine, with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period. Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100μg in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200μg in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg-1), succinylcholine (2mg kg-1) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups. There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group. Two patients in control group and one, receiving neostigmine (200μg), developed nausea/vomiting.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Co administration of epidural neostigmine and lignocaine appears to be a useful technique for postoperative analgesia as it increases the duration of analgesia and provides desirable sedation at the same time.
2	3258678	78-week treatment with tramiprosate 150 mg BID	These adjusted models showed a trend toward a treatment effect for Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale (P = 0.098) and indicated significantly less hippocampus volume loss for tramiprosate 100 mg (P = 0.035) and 150 mg (P = 0.009) compared to placebo. TITLE: Tramiprosate in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease – a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study (the Alphase Study)    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  The aim of the study was to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and disease-modification effects of tramiprosate (homotaurine, ALZHEMEDTM) in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (and 26).   ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS.  Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 67 clinical centres across North America. Patients aged ≥ 50 years, with mild-to-moderate and 26 (Mini-Mental State Examination score between 16 and 26) and on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors, alone or with memantine. Intervention: 78-week treatment with placebo, tramiprosate 100 mg or tramiprosate 150 mg BID. Measurements: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale) and Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes) assessments were performed at baseline and every 13 weeks. Baseline and 78-week magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) hippocampus volume (hippocampus volume) measurements were conducted in a subgroup of patients.     ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A total of 1,052 patients were enrolled and 790 (75.1%) completed the 78-week trial. Patient discontinuation and reasons for withdrawal were similar across groups. Planned analyses did not reveal statistically significant between-group differences. Lack of adequate statistical validity of the planned analysis models led to the development of revised predictive models. The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups.     ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The primary planned analyses did not show a significant treatment effect, but were confounded by unexplained variance. Post-hoc analyses showed a significant treatment-related reduction in hippocampus volume loss. However, there was only a trend towards slowing of decline on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – cognitive subscale and no slowing of decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes. These results must be interpreted in consideration of the limitations of clinical and disease-modification outcome measures and their relationship, the heterogeneity of the disease and the impact of confounding demographic and clinical variables.

2	3883373	Probiotics + antibiotics	During the course of three years, 39% in group I and 50% of participants in group II experienced recurrent urinary tract infectionss (P=0.4). TITLE: Combination of Probiotics and Antibiotics in the Prevention of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection in Children    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  We examined the preventive effect of probiotic and antibiotics versus antibiotics alone, in children with recurrent urinary tract infections (recurrent urinary tract infections) in a preliminary randomized clinical trial.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Between March 2007 and April 2011, children with the history of recurrent urinary tract infections and unilateral vesicoureteral reflux (vesicoureteral reflux) were randomly assigned to receive concomitant probiotic and antibiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium lactis, 107/ml, as 0.25 ml/kg three times a day regimen in addition to Nitrofurantoin, 1mg/kg daily (group I). In group II, all children received conventional prophylactic antibiotics alone (Nitrofurantoin, 1 mg/kg daily). Randomization was performed via using the random numerals table in a 1:1 manner with stratification by sex, age and grade of reflux. The urine examinations were done monthly and the incidence of UTI was evaluated in these two groups.   ABSTRACT.FINDINGS.  Forty-one children (age: 8.3±3.1 years) in group I and 44 children (age: 8.0±3.0 years) in group II were compared. Incidences of UTI - febrile and afebrile - reduced in both groups without any significant differences after two years of prophylaxis. Also, incidence of afebrile UTIs did not significantly differ (0.51±1.30 and 0.81±1.41 respectively, P =0.3); however, the incidence of febrile UTIs in particular were lower in group I (0.00±0.00 versus 0.13±0.40, P =0.03) in the last year.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The consumption of probiotic and antibiotics in children with recurrent urinary tract infections is safe and more effective in reducing the incidence of febrile UTI in comparison to prophylactic antibiotics alone.

TITLE: Effects of vitamin     ABSTRACT.AIMS.  To investigate the effect of short‐term vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic outcomes among individuals with an elevated risk of diabetes.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In a double‐blind placebo‐controlled randomized trial, 340 adults who had an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes (non‐diabetic hyperglycaemia or positive diabetes risk score) were randomized to either placebo, 100 000 IU vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or 100 000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), orally administered monthly for 4 months. The primary outcome was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between baseline and 4 months, adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes included: blood pressure; lipid levels; apolipoprotein levels; C‐reactive protein levels; pulse wave velocity (pulse wave velocity); anthropometric measures; and safety of the supplementation.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The mean [standard deviation (s.d.)] 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]2 concentration increased from 5.2 (4.1) to 53.9 (18.5) nmol/l in the D2 group, and the mean (s.d.) 25(OH)D3 concentration increased from 45.8 (22.6) to 83.8 (22.7) nmol/l in the D3 group. There were no clinically meaningful effects on secondary outcomes, except pulse wave velocity [D2 versus placebo: −0.68 m/s (95% confidence interval −1.31, −0.05); D3 versus placebo −0.73 m/s (95% confidence interval −1.42, −0.03)]. No important safety issues were identified.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Short‐term supplementation with vitamin D2 or D3 had no effect on HbA1c. The modest reduction in pulse wave velocity with both D2 and D3 relative to placebo suggests that vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on arterial stiffness.

Bias is inevitable and needs to be taken into account in any kind of on-treatment analysis in positive airway pressure studies. TITLE: Adaptive servo ventilation for central sleep apnoea in heart failure: SERVE-HF on-treatment analysis    ABSTRACT.  This on-treatment analysis was conducted to facilitate understanding of mechanisms underlying the increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnoea randomised to adaptive servo ventilation versus the control group in the SERVE-HF trial.   Time-dependent on-treatment analyses were conducted (unadjusted and adjusted for predictive covariates). A comprehensive, time-dependent model was developed to correct for asymmetric selection effects (to minimise bias).   The comprehensive model showed increased cardiovascular death hazard ratios during adaptive servo ventilation usage periods, slightly lower than those in the SERVE-HF intention-to-treat analysis. Self-selection bias was evident. Patients randomised to adaptive servo ventilation who crossed over to the control group were at higher risk of cardiovascular death than controls, while control patients with crossover to adaptive servo ventilation showed a trend towards lower risk of cardiovascular death than patients randomised to adaptive servo ventilation. Cardiovascular risk did not increase as nightly adaptive servo ventilation usage increased.

TITLE: Effects of Vildagliptin Add-on Insulin Therapy on Nocturnal Glycemic Variations in Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  To investigate whether vildagliptin add-on insulin therapy improves glycemic variations in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes) compared to patients with placebo therapy.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was a 24-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin therapy were recruited between June 2012 and April 2013. The trial included a 2-week screening period and a 24-week randomized period. Subjects were randomly assigned to a vildagliptin add-on insulin therapy group (n = 17) or a matched placebo group (n = 16). Scheduled visits occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Continuous glucose monitoring (Continuous glucose monitoring) was performed before and at the endpoint of the study.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A total of 33 subjects were admitted, with 1 patient withdrawing from the placebo group. Continuous glucose monitoring data showed that patients with vildagliptin add-on therapy had a significantly lower 24-h mean glucose concentration and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (mean amplitude of glycemic excursion). At the endpoint of the study, patients in the vildagliptin add-on group had a significantly lower mean amplitude of glycemic excursion and standard deviation compared to the control patients during the nocturnal period (0000–0600). A severe hypoglycemic episode was not observed in either group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Vildagliptin add-on therapy to insulin has the ability to improve glycemic variations, especially during the nocturnal time period, in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

TITLE: Effects of Vildagliptin Add-on Insulin Therapy on Nocturnal Glycemic Variations in Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  To investigate whether vildagliptin add-on insulin therapy improves glycemic variations in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes) compared to patients with placebo therapy.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was a 24-week, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin therapy were recruited between June 2012 and April 2013. The trial included a 2-week screening period and a 24-week randomized period. Subjects were randomly assigned to a vildagliptin add-on insulin therapy group (n = 17) or a matched placebo group (n = 16). Scheduled visits occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Continuous glucose monitoring (Continuous glucose monitoring) was performed before and at the endpoint of the study.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  A total of 33 subjects were admitted, with 1 patient withdrawing from the placebo group. After 24 weeks of therapy, HbA1c values were significantly reduced at the endpoint in the vildagliptin add-on group. Continuous glucose monitoring data showed that patients with vildagliptin add-on therapy had a significantly lower 24-h mean glucose concentration and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (mean amplitude of glycemic excursion). At the endpoint of the study, patients in the vildagliptin add-on group had a significantly lower mean amplitude of glycemic excursion and standard deviation compared to the control patients during the nocturnal period (0000–0600). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Vildagliptin add-on therapy to insulin has the ability to improve glycemic variations, especially during the nocturnal time period, in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

TITLE: Intake of Protein Plus Carbohydrate during the First Two Hours after Exhaustive Cycling Improves Performance the following Day    ABSTRACT.  Intake of protein immediately after exercise stimulates protein synthesis but improved recovery of performance is not consistently observed. The primary aim of the present study was to compare performance 18 h after exhaustive cycling in a randomized diet-controlled study (175 kJ·kg-1 during 18 h) when subjects were supplemented with protein plus carbohydrate or carbohydrate only in a 2-h window starting immediately after exhaustive cycling. The second aim was to investigate the effect of no nutrition during the first 2 h and low total energy intake (113 kJ·kg-1 during 18 h) on performance when protein intake was similar. Eight endurance-trained subjects cycled at 237±6 Watt (~72% VO2max) until exhaustion (TTE) on three occasions, and supplemented with 1.2 g carbohydrate·kg-1·h-1 (CHO), 0.8 g carbohydrate + 0.4 g protein·kg-1·h-1 (CHO+PRO) or placebo without energy (PLA). Intake of CHO+PROT increased plasma glucose, insulin, and branch chained amino acids, whereas CHO only increased glucose and insulin. Eighteen hours later, subjects performed another TTE at 237±6 Watt. PLA reduced TTE to 42.8±5.1 min (p<0.05 vs CHO). Nitrogen balance was positive in CHO+PROT, and negative in CHO and PLA. In conclusion, performance was higher 18 h after exhaustive cycling with intake of CHO+PROT compared to an isocaloric amount of carbohydrate during the first 2 h post exercise. Intake of a similar amount of protein but less carbohydrate during the 18 h recovery period reduced performance.

2	4163237	Low pressure carbon dioxide	Results: The frequency of Postoperative nausea and vomiting in the low pressure and standard pressure groups did not demonstrate statistically significant different (P > 0.05). TITLE: Comparison of low and standard pressure gas injection at abdominal cavity on postoperative nausea and vomiting in laparoscopic cholecystectomy    ABSTRACT.   Background and Objective: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (Postoperative nausea and vomiting) is the main concern for 40-70% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our objective was to compare carbon dioxide gas at low pressure and standard pressure for the occurrence of Postoperative nausea and vomiting on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.    Methods: This double- blind trial was conducted on 50 women patients aged between 18 to 60 years with acute cholecystectomy. The patients were divided into two groups: low pressure (low pressure) (received low pressure gas, 7-9 mmHg) and standard pressure (standard pressure) (received standard pressure gas, 14-15 mmHg). Nausea and vomiting in patients at hours 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 after the surgery were recorded.    Nevertheless the frequency of shoulder pain after 4 hours at the low pressure group compared with standard pressure group was significantly different (P < 0.023).    Conclusions: The use of low pressure gas compared to standard pressure gas to create pneumoperitoneum could not reduce the Postoperative nausea and vomiting whereas the frequency of shoulder pain in low pressure group was reduced. Low pressure gas was associated with reduction of surgeon visibility and subsequently more prolonged surgery duration.

2	5091022	3.2 mm drain	Regarding the hematocrit, there were no differences between groups in measured periods (24, 48, and 72 h after surgery). TITLE: Does the suction drain diameter matter? Bleeding analysis after total knee replacement comparing different suction drain gauges    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  To evaluate bleeding and the estimated blood loss in patients who underwent total knee replacement (total knee replacement) with different closed suction drains (3.2-mm and 4.8-mm gauge).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This was a randomized controlled trial with 22 patients who underwent total knee replacement and were divided into two groups: Group I, with 11 patients in whom the 3.2-mm suction drain was used, and Group II, with 11 patients in whom the 4.8-mm suction drain was used. The hematocrit was measured after 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery in order to calculate the estimated blood loss. The drained volume was measured 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after total knee replacement, and thereafter both groups were compared.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The total bleeding measured at the suction drains within 48 h was higher in Group II, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.005); in the first 24 h, there was major bleeding in Group II (mean 893 mL), with a significant difference (p = 0.004). Between 24 and 48 h, there was no statistically significant difference in both groups (p = 0.710). The total estimated bleeding was higher in Group I, with mean of 463 mL, versus 409 mL in Group II, with no statistical significance (p = 0.394).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Bleeding was higher in the group that used the 4.8 mm gauge suction drain, with no differences in hematocrit and estimated blood loss.

2	5518918	Home-based training with telemonitoring	Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval –562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval –460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively).   TITLE: Clinical and cost-effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to conventional, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation: Results of the FIT@Home study    ABSTRACT.AIM.  Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.  We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p < 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.

However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.

TITLE: Clinical and cost-effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to conventional, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation: Results of the FIT@Home study    ABSTRACT.AIM.  Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.  We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval –562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95% confidence interval –460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively).

Minimal mean hepatic threshold dose 6 weeks after radiotherapy (primary endpoint) was significantly higher in the study treatment-group compared with the control (19.1 Gy versus 14.6 Gy, p = 0.011). TITLE: Prospective Randomized Trial of Enoxaparin, Pentoxifylline and Ursodeoxycholic Acid for Prevention of Radiation-Induced Liver Toxicity    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND/AIM.  Targeted radiotherapy of liver malignancies has found to be effective in selected patients. A key limiting factor of these therapies is the relatively low tolerance of the liver parenchyma to radiation. We sought to assess the preventive effects of a combined regimen of pentoxifylline (pentoxifylline), ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodeoxycholic acid) and low-dose low molecular weight heparin (low molecular weight heparin) on focal radiation-induced liver injury (focal radiation-induced liver injury).   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND MATERIALS.  Patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for local ablation by radiotherapy (image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy) were prospectively randomized to receive pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid and low molecular weight heparin for 8 weeks (treatment) or no medication (control). Focal RILI at follow-up was assessed using functional hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging). A minimal threshold dose, i.e. the dose to which the outer rim of the focal radiation-induced liver injury was formerly exposed to, was quantified by merging magnetic resonance imaging and dosimetry data.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Results from an intended interim-analysis made a premature termination necessary. Twenty-two patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. Qualitative evidence of focal radiation-induced liver injury by magnetic resonance imaging at 6 weeks was observed in 45.5% of patients in the treatment versus 90.9% of the control group. No significant differences between the groups were observed at the 12-week follow-up.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The post-therapeutic application of pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose low molecular weight heparin significantly reduced the extent and incidence focal radiation-induced liver injury at 6 weeks after radiotherapy. The development of subsequent focal radiation-induced liver injury at 12 weeks (4 weeks after cessation of pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid and low molecular weight heparin during weeks 1–8) in the treatment group was comparable to the control group thus supporting the observation that the agents mitigated focal radiation-induced liver injury.

TITLE: The effect of the training with the different combinations of frequency and peak-to-peak vibration displacement of whole-body vibration on the strength of knee flexors and extensors    ABSTRACT.  Whole-body vibration training has become a popular method used in sports and physiotherapy. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of different vibration frequency and peak-to-peak displacement combinations on men knee flexors and extensors strength in isokinetic conditions. The sample consisted of 49 male subjects randomly allocated to seven comparative groups, six of which exercised on a vibration platform with parameters set individually for the groups. The experimental groups were exposed to vibrations 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The pre- and post- isokinetic strength tests, with the angular velocities of 240°/s and 30°/s, were recorded prior to and 2 days after the training. After 4 weeks of whole-body vibration training, a significant increase was noted regarding the mean values of peak torque, average peak torque and total work for knee flexors at high angular velocity in Groups I (60 Hz/4 mm) and V (40 Hz/2 mm) (p<0.05). Whole-body vibrations during static exercise beneficially affected knee flexor strength profile in young men at high angular velocity. The combinations of 60 Hz/4 mm seem to have the most advantageous effects on muscle strength parameters.

2	4808872	Creatine Supplementation	After the supplementation, the 1RM strength in the creatine group significantly increased (p < 0.05). TITLE: The Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Explosive Performance and Optimal Individual Postactivation Potentiation Time    ABSTRACT.  Creatine plays an important role in muscle energy metabolism. Postactivation potentiation (Postactivation potentiation) is a phenomenon that can acutely increase muscle power, but it is an individualized process that is influenced by muscle fatigue. This study examined the effects of creatine supplementation on explosive performance and the optimal individual Postactivation potentiation time during a set of complex training bouts. Thirty explosive athletes performed tests of back squat for one repetition maximum (1RM) strength and complex training bouts for determining the individual optimal timing of Postactivation potentiation, height and peak power of a counter movement jump before and after the supplementation. Subjects were assigned to a creatine or placebo group and then consumed 20 g of creatine or carboxymethyl cellulose per day for six days. The optimal individual Postactivation potentiation time in the creatine group was also significant earlier than the pre-supplementation and post-supplementation of the placebo group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in jump performance between the groups. This study demonstrates that creatine supplementation improves maximal muscle strength and the optimal individual Postactivation potentiation time of complex training but has no effect on explosive performance.

After the supplementation, the 1RM strength in the creatine group significantly increased (p < 0.05). The optimal individual Postactivation potentiation time in the creatine group was also significant earlier than the pre-supplementation and post-supplementation of the placebo group (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that creatine supplementation improves maximal muscle strength and the optimal individual Postactivation potentiation time of complex training but has no effect on explosive performance.

TITLE: Restrictive intraoperative fluid optimisation algorithm improves outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy: A prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.  We aimed to evaluate perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with or without a cardiac output goal directed therapy (goal directed therapy) algorithm. We conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial in four high volume hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery centres. We evaluated whether the additional impact of a intraoperative fluid optimisation algorithm would influence the amount of fluid delivered, reduce fluid related complications, and improve length of hospital stay. Fifty-two consecutive adult patients were recruited. The median (IQR) duration of surgery was 8.6 hours (7.1:9.6) in the goal directed therapy group vs. 7.8 hours (6.8:9.0) in the usual care group (p = 0.2). Total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively was also lower in the goal directed therapy group: 2050mL (1313:2700) vs. 4088mL (3400:4525), p<0.0001 and vasoactive medications were used more frequently. There were no significant differences in proportions of patients experiencing overall complications (p = 0.179); however, fewer complications occurred in the goal directed therapy group: 44 vs. 92 (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.41; 95%CI 0.24 to 0.69, p = 0.001). Median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 9.5 days (IQR: 7.0, 14.3) in the goal directed therapy vs. 12.5 days in the usual care group (IQR: 9.0, 22.3) for an Incidence Rate Ratio 0.64 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.85, p = 0.002). In conclusion, using a surgery-specific, patient-specific goal directed restrictive fluid therapy algorithm in this cohort of patients, can justify using enough fluid without causing oedema, yet as little fluid as possible without causing hypovolaemia i.e. "precision" fluid therapy. Our findings support the use of a perioperative haemodynamic optimization plan that prioritizes preservation of cardiac output and organ perfusion pressure by judicious use of fluid therapy, rational use of vasoactive drugs and timely application of inotropic drugs. They also suggest the need for further larger studies to confirm its findings.

TITLE: Assessing the Effect of an Integrated Control Strategy for Schistosomiasis Japonica Emphasizing Bovines in a Marshland Area of Hubei Province, China: A Cluster Randomized Trial    ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION.  More than 80% of schistosomiasis patients in China live in the lake and marshland regions. The purpose of our study is to assess the effect of a comprehensive strategy to control transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in marshland regions.   ABSTRACT.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS.  In a cluster randomized controlled trial, we implemented an integrated control strategy in twelve villages from 2009 through 2011 in Gong'an County, Hubei Province. The routine interventions included praziquantel chemotherapy and controlling snails, and were implemented in all villages. New interventions, mainly consisting of building fences to limit the grazing area for bovines, building safe pastures for grazing, improving the residents' health conditions and facilities, were only implemented in six intervention villages. In contrast, there were no statistically significant reductions of S. japonicum infection in humans, bovines and snails from 2008 to 2011 in the control group (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Moreover, a generalized linear model showed that there was a higher infection risk in humans in the control group than in the intervention group (OR = 1.250, P = 0.001) and an overall significant downward trend in infection risk during the study period.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE.  The integrated control strategy, designed to reduce the role of bovines and humans as sources of S. japonicum infection, was highly effective in controlling the transmission of S. japonicum in marshland regions in China.

A pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention was designed to measure the impact of the program (PRONTO intervention) on a sample of 24 hospitals (12 hospitals received the PRONTO training and 12 served as controls) in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Mexico. We estimated the impact of receiving the intervention on the probability of birth practices performance in a sample of 641 observed births of which 318 occurred in the treated hospitals and 323 occurred in control hospitals. Data was collected at 4 time points (baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th months after the training). Women were blinded to treatment allocation but observers and providers were not. Estimates were obtained by fitting difference-in-differences logistic regression models considering confounding variables. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: # NCT01477554.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Significant changes were found following the intervention. increase of the 1st step of Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (p = 0.026) and a 42 p.p. increase of Delayed Cord Clamping (p = 0.004); at 4 months a 30 (p = 0.001) and at 8 months a 22 (p = 0.010) p.p. decrease for Uterine Sweeping.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The intervention has an impact on adopting evidence-based practices at birth, contributing to an increased quality of care. Long lasting impacts on these practices are possible if there were to be a widespread adoption of the training techniques including simulation, team-training and facilitated discussions regarding routine care.

To perform a secondary analysis to evaluate the impact of a simulation and team-training program (PRONTO) on the performance of evidence-based practices in normal births.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention was designed to measure the impact of the program (PRONTO intervention) on a sample of 24 hospitals (12 hospitals received the PRONTO training and 12 served as controls) in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Mexico. We estimated the impact of receiving the intervention on the probability of birth practices performance in a sample of 641 observed births of which 318 occurred in the treated hospitals and 323 occurred in control hospitals. Data was collected at 4 time points (baseline, 4th, 8th and 12th months after the training). Women were blinded to treatment allocation but observers and providers were not. Estimates were obtained by fitting difference-in-differences logistic regression models considering confounding variables. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: # NCT01477554.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Significant changes were found following the intervention. At 4 months post-intervention an increase of 20 percentage points (p.p.) for complete Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (Active Management of Third Stage of Labor) (p = 0.044), and 16 p.p. decrease for Uterine Sweeping.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The intervention has an impact on adopting evidence-based practices at birth, contributing to an increased quality of care. Long lasting impacts on these practices are possible if there were to be a widespread adoption of the training techniques including simulation, team-training and facilitated discussions regarding routine care.

2	5928476	SureFil SDR or EverX Posterior bulk-fill composite resins' bond	SureFil SDR and EverX Posterior bulk-fill composite resins' bond strengths were significantly higher than ProRoot MTA and Biodentine calcium silicate cements. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between bulk-fill composite resins values and calcium silicate cement values.     TITLE: Push-out bond strength of intra-orifice barrier materials: Bulk-fill composite versus calcium silicate cement    ABSTRACT.   Background. The aim of this study was to compare the push-out bond strengths of calcium silicate-based ProRoot MTA and Biodentine cements and SureFil SDR and EverX Posterior bulk-fill composite resins.     Methods. Twenty-four single-rooted maxillary central incisors were sectioned below the cementoenamel junction, and the root canals were instrumented using rotary files. Thereafter, a parallel post drill was used to obtain a standardized root canal dimension. The roots were randomly assigned to one of the following groups with respect to the intra-orifice barrier used: ProRoot MTA; Biodentine; SureFil SDR; EverX Posterior. Five 1-mm-thick sections were obtained from the coronal aspect of each root. Push-out bond strength testing was performed and data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests (P<0.05).     Results. Conclusion. Within the limitations of present study, calcium silicate-based ProRoot MTA cement's push-out bond strength was lower than those of Biodentine, SureFil SDR and EverX Posterior materials.

2	4173437	Tranexamic acid	Postoperatively hematocrit values were higher in the tranexamic acid group. TITLE: The prophylactic role of tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss during radical surgery: A prospective study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  The radical surgical procedures are associated with perioperative blood loss. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients undergoing radical surgery.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  Sixty ASA class I and II adult consented female patients, scheduled for elective radical surgery and met the inclusion criterion, were blindly randomized into two groups to receive either intravenous 1 g tranexamic acid 20 min before skin incision or an equivalent volume of normal saline as placebo (placebo). All patient's total blood loss was measured and recorded perioperatively at the 12thh postoperatively. The preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, hematocrit values, serum creatinine, activated thromboplastin time, prothombin time, thrombocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and symptoms of pulmonary embolism were comparatively evaluated.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  The tranexamic acid significantly reduced the quantity of total blood loss, 576 ± 53 mL in study group as compared to 823 ± 74 mL in the control group (P<0.01). The coagulation profile did not differ between the groups, but D-dimer concentrations were increased in the control group. No complications or adverse effects were reported in the either group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid has effectively reduced theblood loss and transfusion needs during radical surgery without any adverse effects or complication of thrombosis.

2	2680972	"early ART" - given within 14 days of starting acute OI treatment	The difference in the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance: AIDS progression/death was seen in 20 (14%) vs. 34 (24%); whereas no progression but with incomplete viral suppression was seen in 54 (38%) vs. 44 (31%); and no progression with optimal viral suppression in 67 (48%) vs 63 (45%) in the early vs. deferred arm, respectively (p = 0.22). TITLE: Early Antiretroviral Therapy Reduces AIDS Progression/Death in Individuals with Acute Opportunistic Infections: A Multicenter Randomized Strategy Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Optimal timing of ART initiation for individuals presenting with AIDS-related OIs has not been defined.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND FINDINGS.  A5164 was a randomized strategy trial of "early ART" - given within 14 days of starting acute OI treatment versus "deferred ART" - given after acute OI treatment is completed. Randomization was stratified by presenting OI and entry CD4 count. The primary week 48 endpoint was 3-level ordered categorical variable: 1. Death/AIDS progression; 2. No progression with incomplete viral suppression (ie HIV viral load (viral load) ≥50 copies/ml); 3. No progression with optimal viral suppression (ie HIV viral load <50 copies/ml). Secondary endpoints included: AIDS progression/death; plasma HIV RNA and CD4 responses and safety parameters including IRIS.   282 subjects were evaluable; 141 per arm. Entry OIs included Pneumocytis jirovecii pneumonia 63%, cryptococcal meningitis 12%, and bacterial infections 12%. The early and deferred arms started ART a median of 12 and 45 days after start of OI treatment, respectively.

2	4836241	Control	At the 4th week after gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating score results were as follows: Control group > Kuntai group > Tibolone group (P < 0.05); at the 8th and 12th week after gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating score in Control group were significantly higher than the other two groups (P < 0.05), and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone group (P > 0.05). TITLE: Efficacy and Safety Investigation of Kuntai Capsule for the Add-back Therapy of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Agonist Administration to Endometriosis Patients: A Randomized, Double-blind, Blank- and Tibolone-controlled Study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  As a Chinese Traditional Medicine product, Kuntai capsule could improve the peri-menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. But it is still not clear whether Kuntai capsule has a good effect on alleviating peri-menopausal symptoms induced by gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist) treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Kuntai capsule, on peri-menopausal symptoms in endometriosis (endometriosis) patients, with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:. Ninety endometriosis ovarian cyst women with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration were enrolled in the study, and were randomly divided into Kuntai group, Tibolone group, or blank Control group. The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid,po for 12 weeks after the first gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist injection, while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd, po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group. There was no drug addition in Control group. Climacteric complaints were evaluated by Kupperman menopausal index (Kupperman menopausal index) and hot flash/sweating score. Liver and renal functions, lipid profile, serum sex hormone levels and endometrial thickness were measured, and the frequency of adverse events in Kuntai and Tibolone groups was recorded.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. (1) Before gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, the baseline parameter results were comparable in the three groups (P > 0.05). (2) After gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly (P < 0.05). (3) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment (P > 0.05). (4) The posttherapeutic serum follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle-stimulating hormone), luteinizing hormone (luteinizing hormone) and estradiol (E2) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups (P < 0.05). After therapy, serum E2 level in Tibolone group was obviously higher than the other two groups (P < 0.05), while follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were obviously lower (P < 0.05). (5) The incidence of vaginal bleeding, breast distending pain in Tibolne group was obviously higher than Kuntai group (P < 0. 05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration to endometriosis patients, although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone. Kuntai capsule might be a little safer than Tibolone tablet.

(2) After gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly (P < 0.05). At the 4th week after gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating score results were as follows: Control group > Kuntai group > Tibolone group (P < 0.05); at the 8th and 12th week after gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating score in Control group were significantly higher than the other two groups (P < 0.05), and no significant difference was identified between Kuntai and Tibolone group (P > 0.05). (3) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment (P > 0.05). (4) The posttherapeutic serum follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle-stimulating hormone), luteinizing hormone (luteinizing hormone) and estradiol (E2) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups (P < 0.05). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration to endometriosis patients, although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone. Kuntai capsule might be a little safer than Tibolone tablet.

TITLE: Efficacy and Safety Investigation of Kuntai Capsule for the Add-back Therapy of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Agonist Administration to Endometriosis Patients: A Randomized, Double-blind, Blank- and Tibolone-controlled Study    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  As a Chinese Traditional Medicine product, Kuntai capsule could improve the peri-menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. But it is still not clear whether Kuntai capsule has a good effect on alleviating peri-menopausal symptoms induced by gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist) treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of Kuntai capsule, on peri-menopausal symptoms in endometriosis (endometriosis) patients, with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:. Ninety endometriosis ovarian cyst women with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration were enrolled in the study, and were randomly divided into Kuntai group, Tibolone group, or blank Control group. The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid,po for 12 weeks after the first gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist injection, while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd, po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group.

Ninety endometriosis ovarian cyst women with postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration were enrolled in the study, and were randomly divided into Kuntai group, Tibolone group, or blank Control group. The therapeutic strategy in Kuntai group was 4 Kuntai capsules tid,po for 12 weeks after the first gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist injection, while Tibolone 2.5 mg qd, po for 12 weeks in Tibolone group. There was no drug addition in Control group. Climacteric complaints were evaluated by Kupperman menopausal index (Kupperman menopausal index) and hot flash/sweating score. Liver and renal functions, lipid profile, serum sex hormone levels and endometrial thickness were measured, and the frequency of adverse events in Kuntai and Tibolone groups was recorded.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. (1) Before gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, the baseline parameter results were comparable in the three groups (P > 0.05). (2) After gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy, Kupperman menopausal index and hot flash/sweating scores in all the three groups increased significantly (P < 0.05). (3) No statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment (P > 0.05). (4) The posttherapeutic serum follicle-stimulating hormone (follicle-stimulating hormone), luteinizing hormone (luteinizing hormone) and estradiol (E2) level and endometrial thickness decreased significantly in all the three groups (P < 0.05). After therapy, serum E2 level in Tibolone group was obviously higher than the other two groups (P < 0.05), while follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels were obviously lower (P < 0.05). (5) The incidence of vaginal bleeding, breast distending pain in Tibolne group was obviously higher than Kuntai group (P < 0. 05).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  Kuntai capsule is effective on the peri-menopausal symptoms induced by postoperative gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist administration to endometriosis patients, although its clinical effect might be a few weeks later than Tibolone. Kuntai capsule might be a little safer than Tibolone tablet.

TITLE: Assessment of Unconscious Decision Aids Applied to Complex Patient-Centered Medical Decisions    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  To improve patient health, recent research urges for medical decision aids that are designed to enhance the effectiveness of specific medically related decisions. Many such decisions involve complex information, and decision aids that independently use deliberative (analytical and slower) or intuitive (more affective and automatic) cognitive processes for such decisions result in suboptimal decisions. Unconscious thought can arguably use both intuitive and deliberative (slow and analytic) processes, and this combination may further benefit complex patient (or practitioner) decisions as medical decision aids. Indeed, mounting research demonstrates that individuals render better decisions generally if they are distracted from thinking consciously about complex information after it is presented (but can think unconsciously), relative to thinking about that information consciously or not at all.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The current research tested whether the benefits of unconscious thought processes can be replicated using an Internet platform for a patient medical decision involving complex information. This research also explored the possibility that judgments reported after a period of unconscious thought are actually the result of a short period of conscious deliberation occurring during the decision report phase.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A total of 173 participants in a Web-based experiment received information about four medical treatments, the best (worst) associated with mostly positive (negative) side-effects/attributes and the others with equal positive-negative ratios. Next, participants were either distracted for 3 minutes (unconscious thought), instructed to think about the information for 3 minutes (conscious thought), or moved directly to the decision task (immediate decision). Finally, participants reported their choice of, and attitudes toward, the treatments while experiencing high, low, or no cognitive load, which varied their ability to think consciously while reporting judgments. Cognitive load was manipulated by having participants memorize semi-random (high), line structured (low), or no dot patterns and recall these intermittently with their decision reports. Overall then, participants were randomly assigned to the conditions of a 3 (thought condition) by 3 (cognitive-load level) between-subjects design.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  No difference was observed between the conscious-thought condition compared to the immediate-decision condition, and cognitive load manipulations did not affect choices or alter the above finding.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This research demonstrates a plausible benefit of unconscious thinking as a decision aid for complex medical decisions, and represents the first use of unconscious thought processes as a patient-centered medical decision aid. Further, the quality of decisions reached unconsciously does not appear to be affected by the amount of cognitive load participants experienced.

2	3767244	Moderate-intensity exercise training	There was a decrease in salivary cortisol at wake (P = 0.025) in the exercise group and a trend (P = 0.07) for a decrease 1 hour after waking. TITLE: Moderate-Intensity Exercise Improves Body Composition and Improves Physiological Markers of Stress in HIV-Infected Men    ABSTRACT.  HIV/AIDS and its treatment often alter body composition and result in poorer physical functioning. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a moderate-intensity exercise program on body composition and the hormones and cytokines associated with adverse health outcomes. HIV-infected males (N = 111) were randomized to an exercise group (exercise group) who completed 6 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise training, or to a nonintervention control group (control group). In pre- and postintervention, body composition was estimated via DXA, peak strength was assessed, and resting blood samples were obtained. The exercise group had a significant increase in lean tissue mass (lean tissue mass) (P < 0.001) following the intervention. Those in the exercise group below median body fat (20%) increased lean tissue mass (P = 0.014) only, while those above 20% decreased fat mass (P = 0.02), total fat (N = 0.009), and trunk fat (P = 0.001), while also increasing lean tissue mass (P = 0.027). Peak strength increased between 14% and 28% on all exercises in the exercise group group. These data indicate that 6 weeks of moderate-intensity exercise training can decrease salivary cortisol levels, improve physical performance, and improve body composition in HIV-infected men.

2	3295238	Nifedipine	Blood pressure was lower on nifedipine than on placebo by 5.8/2.1 mmHg (P < 0.001) as was total and LDL cholesterol (4.8 mg/dL; P = 0.495), while HDL was higher (3.6 mg/dL; P = 0.026). TITLE: A randomized placebo-controlled study on the effect of nifedipine on coronary endothelial function and plaque formation in patients with coronary artery disease: the ENCORE II study    ABSTRACT.AIMS.  Endothelial dysfunction and plaque formation are features of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of L-type calcium channels or HMG-CoA pathway improves endothelial function and reduces plaque size. Thus, we investigated in stable coronary artery disease (coronary artery disease) the effects of a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function and plaque size.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.  In 454 patients undergoing PCI, acetylcholine (10−6 to 10−4 M) was infused in a coronary segment without significant coronary artery disease. Changes in coronary diameter were measured and an intravascular ultrasound examination (intravascular ultrasound examination) was performed. On top of statin therapy, patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to placebo or nifedipine GITS 30–60 mg/day and followed for 18–24 months.   In the most constricting segment, nifedipine reduced vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (14.0% vs. placebo 7.7%; P < 0.0088). The percentage change in plaque volume with nifedipine and placebo, respectively, was 1.0 and 1.9%, ns.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  The ENCORE II trial demonstrates in a multi-centre setting that calcium channel blockade with nifedipine for up to 2 years improves coronary endothelial function on top of statin treatment, but did not show an effect of nifedipine on plaque volume.

2	5518919	Probiotics	At end-point, 9 (23%) of those in the probiotic group showed a ⩾60% change on the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (responders), compared to 10 (26%) of those in the placebo group (χ12=0.107, p = ns). TITLE: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of     ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:.  This trial investigated whether probiotics improved mood, stress and anxiety in a sample selected for low mood. We also tested whether the presence or severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other blood markers, would predict or impact treatment response.   ABSTRACT.METHOD:.  Seventy-nine participants (10 dropouts) not currently taking psychotropic medications with at least moderate scores on self-report mood measures were randomly allocated to receive either a probiotic preparation (containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum) or a matched placebo, in a double-blind trial for 8 weeks. Data were analysed as intent-to-treat.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  No significant difference was found between the probiotic and placebo groups on any psychological outcome measure (Cohen's d range = 0.07–0.16) or any blood-based biomarker. Baseline vitamin D level was found to moderate treatment effect on several outcome measures. Dry mouth and sleep disruption were reported more frequently in the placebo group.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  This study found no evidence that the probiotic formulation is effective in treating low mood, or in moderating the levels of inflammatory and other biomarkers. The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample; recruiting an antidepressant-naive sample experiencing mild, acute symptoms of low mood, may well yield a different result. Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area. The results of this trial are preliminary; future studies in the area should not be discouraged.

2	5244277	fluticasone furoate nasal spray	More patients stated a preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray for the attributes of "less drip down the throat" (p < 0.001), "less run out of the nose" (p < 0.05), "more soothing" (p < 0.05), and "less irritating" (p < 0.001). TITLE: A patient preference study that evaluated fluticasone furoate and mometasone furoate nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Corticosteroid nasal sprays are the mainstay of treatment for allergic rhinitis. These sprays have sensory attributes such as scent and/or odor, taste and aftertaste, and run down the throat and/or the nose, which, when unpleasant, can affect patient preference for, and compliance with, treatment.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:.  This study examined patient preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray (fluticasone furoate nasal spray) or mometasone furoate nasal spray (mometasone furoate nasal spray) based on their sensory attributes after administration in patients with allergic rhinitis.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Patient preferences were determined by using three questionnaires (Overall Preference, Immediate Attributes, and Delayed Attributes).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Overall, 56% of patients stated a preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus 32% for mometasone furoate nasal spray (p < 0.001); the remaining 12% stated no preference. More patients responded in favor of fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray for the immediate attributes, "run down the throat" (p < 0.001), and "run out of the nose" (p < 0.001), and, in the delayed attributes, "run down the throat" (p < 0.001), "run out of the nose" (p < 0.01), "presence of aftertaste" (p < 0.01), and "no nasal irritation" (p < 0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Patients with allergic rhinitis preferred fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray overall and based on a number of individual attributes, including "less drip down the throat," "less run out of the nose," and "less irritating. " Greater preference may improve patient adherence and thereby improve symptom management of the patient's allergic rhinitis.

ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Patient preferences were determined by using three questionnaires (Overall Preference, Immediate Attributes, and Delayed Attributes).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  More patients stated a preference for fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray for the attributes of "less drip down the throat" (p < 0.001), "less run out of the nose" (p < 0.05), "more soothing" (p < 0.05), and "less irritating" (p < 0.001). More patients responded in favor of fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray for the immediate attributes, "run down the throat" (p < 0.001), and "run out of the nose" (p < 0.001), and, in the delayed attributes, "run down the throat" (p < 0.001), "run out of the nose" (p < 0.01), "presence of aftertaste" (p < 0.01), and "no nasal irritation" (p < 0.001).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Patients with allergic rhinitis preferred fluticasone furoate nasal spray versus mometasone furoate nasal spray overall and based on a number of individual attributes, including "less drip down the throat," "less run out of the nose," and "less irritating. " Greater preference may improve patient adherence and thereby improve symptom management of the patient's allergic rhinitis.

2	5937795	confinement housing	Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between Complete Fecal Collection and Interval Collection samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1). TITLE: Impact of confinement housing on study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children < 5 years globally and the parasite genus Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of that diarrhea. The global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial and the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. Chemotherapeutic development is dependent on the calf model of cryptosporidiosis, which is the best approximation of human disease. However, the model is not consistently applied across research studies. Data collection commonly occurs using two different methods: Complete Fecal Collection (Complete Fecal Collection), which requires use of confinement housing, and Interval Collection (Interval Collection), which permits use of box stalls. Complete Fecal Collection mimics human challenge model methodology but it is unknown if confinement housing impacts study end-points and if data gathered via this method is suitable for generalization to human populations.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Using a modified crossover study design we compared Complete Fecal Collection and Interval Collection and evaluated the impact of housing on study end-points. At birth, calves were randomly assigned to confinement (n = 14) or box stall housing (n = 9), or were challenged with 5 x 107 C. parvum oocysts, and followed for 10 days. Study end-points included fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and plasma cortisol.   ABSTRACT.FINDINGS.  Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Housing method confounds study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis. Due to increased stress data collected from calves in confinement housing may not accurately estimate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics targeting C. parvum.

TITLE: Flail Chest in Polytraumatized Patients: Surgical Fixation Using Stracos Reduces Ventilator Time and Hospital Stay    ABSTRACT.   Objectives. Conservative management of patients with flail chest is the treatment of choice. Rib fracture repair is technically challenging; however, with the advent of specially designed molding titanium clips, surgical management has been simplified. Surgical stabilization has been used with good outcomes. We are reporting on our institutional matched-case-control study. Methods. Between April 2010 and April 2011, ten polytraumatized patients undergoing rib stabilization for flail chest were matched 1 : 1 to 10 control patients by age ±10 years, sex, neurological or vertebral trauma, abdominal injury, and arm and leg fractures. Surgery was realized in the first 48 hours. Results. Ventilator time (142 ± 224 versus 74 ± 125 hours, P = 0.026) and overall hospital stay (142 ± 224 versus 74 ± 125 hours, P = 0.026) were significantly lower for the surgical group after adjustment on prognostic scores. There was a trend towards shorter ICU stay for operative patients (12.3 ± 8.5 versus 9.0 ± 4.3 days, P = 0.076). Conclusions. Rib fixation with Stracos is feasible and decreases the length of ventilation and hospital stay. A multicenter randomized study is warranted so as to confirm these results and to evaluate impact on pulmonary function status, pain, and quality of life.

Between April 2010 and April 2011, ten polytraumatized patients undergoing rib stabilization for flail chest were matched 1 : 1 to 10 control patients by age ±10 years, sex, neurological or vertebral trauma, abdominal injury, and arm and leg fractures. Surgery was realized in the first 48 hours. Results. There were no significant differences between groups for matched data and prognostic scores: injury severity score, revised trauma score, and trauma injury severity score. Ventilator time (142 ± 224 versus 74 ± 125 hours, P = 0.026) and overall hospital stay (142 ± 224 versus 74 ± 125 hours, P = 0.026) were significantly lower for the surgical group after adjustment on prognostic scores. Conclusions. Rib fixation with Stracos is feasible and decreases the length of ventilation and hospital stay. A multicenter randomized study is warranted so as to confirm these results and to evaluate impact on pulmonary function status, pain, and quality of life.

2	4472776	Chlorhexidine gluconate dressing	The mean cost difference per patient of €141 is not statistically significant (95% confidence interval: [€-975; €1,258]). TITLE: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Transparent Antimicrobial Dressing for Managing Central Venous and Arterial Catheters in Intensive Care Units    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To model the cost-effectiveness impact of routine use of an antimicrobial chlorhexidine gluconate-containing securement dressing compared to non-antimicrobial transparent dressings for the protection of central vascular lines in intensive care unit patients.   ABSTRACT.DESIGN.  This study uses a novel health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of using the chlorhexidine gluconate dressing versus transparent dressings in a French intensive care unit scenario. The 30-day time non-homogeneous markovian model comprises eight health states. The probabilities of events derive from a multicentre (12 French intensive care units) randomized controlled trial. 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations of 1,000 patients per dressing strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The outcome is the number of catheter-related bloodstream infections avoided. Costs of intensive care unit stay are based on a recent French multicentre study and the cost-effectiveness criterion is the cost per catheter-related bloodstream infections avoided. The incremental net monetary benefit per patient is also estimated.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS.  1000 patients per group simulated based on the source randomized controlled trial involving 1,879 adults expected to require intravascular catheterization for 48 hours.   ABSTRACT.INTERVENTION.  Chlorhexidine Gluconate-containing securement dressing compared to non-antimicrobial transparent dressings.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The chlorhexidine gluconate dressing prevents 11.8 infections /1,000 patients (95% confidence interval: [3.85; 19.64]) with a number needed to treat of 85 patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is of €12,046 per catheter-related bloodstream infection prevented, and the incremental net monetary benefit per patient is of €344.88.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  According to the base case scenario, the chlorhexidine gluconate dressing is more cost-effective than the reference dressing.   ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION.  This model is based on the data from the RCT registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01189682).

2	5609346	GPP	The two groups with the thinking protocol leaped from exploitation to exploration (p<0.0001); the other two groups remained in exploitation (p=0.1173, p=0.0758). TITLE: Better patient safety: implementing exploration and exploitation learning in daily medical practice    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Current medical daily practice relies on guidelines, protocols and procedures (guidelines, protocols and procedures), which require exploitation. However, diagnosis, treatment, risk management and process improvements require exploration. Physician are often unable to switch between exploitation and exploration. This study tested a new approach to facilitate switching that included (1) a new 'thinking protocol' that encouraged leaping from exploitation to exploration and (2) a GPP that encouraged leaping from exploration to exploitation.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  Two hundred students were divided into four groups. The groups received a set of tasks that required switching between exploitation and exploration. Three groups received the thinking protocol, the GPP, or both, and the fourth group served as control.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  With each additional task, all groups increased exploitative tendency(p<0.0001). For the groups that employed exploration learning, the group that received the GPP switched back to exploitation (p<0.0001), but the other group remained in exploration (p=0.2363).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Despite the importance of timely leaping between exploration and exploitation, in some events, medical teams fail to make the appropriate leap. We suggest to use our novel approach and to encourage the leaping between exploration and exploitation in daily medical practice, to enable the prevention of medical errors and to enhance the effectiveness of risk managements and process improvements.

TITLE: The Effect of Ramadan Fasting and Physical Activity on Body Composition, Serum Osmolarity Levels and Some Parameters of Electrolytes in Females    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  So far, there have been a few and incoherent results about the effects of physical activities. Fasting in Ramadan has an effect on the level of osmolarity and the concentration of serum electrolytes both in active and inactive females.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to observe the changes of serum electrolytes and osmolarity levels according to regular exercise during fasting.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  Twenty two healthy females who were elected by convenience sampling method were divided into two groups: 1) fasting + exercise (fasting + exercise; n = 11) and 2) fasting + non exercise (fasting + non exercise; n = 15). The fasting + exercise group participated in aerobic training for four sessions per week during the fasting. All measurements were done once before the first day, on the second week, on the fourth week and two weeks after fasting month and these measures were used to analyze test results.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The mean differences were as follows: significant weight loss, BMI, WHR, in two groups at the end of Ramadan (P < 0.05). Potassium, creatinine, urea and uric acid had been decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.05). Variance between groups was significant only in variable urea (P < 0.05). Variations within group had been changed in FBS; sodium, phosphorus and osmolarity levels were not changed significantly.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  According to this result, regular exercise in case of fasting in Ramadan led to some changes in serum osmolarity index, electrolytes and water. Therefore, it is important for female athletes to consider applying a suitable nutritious diet and sufficient water consumption during Ramadan

Variations within group had been changed in FBS; sodium, phosphorus and osmolarity levels were not changed significantly.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  According to this result, regular exercise in case of fasting in Ramadan led to some changes in serum osmolarity index, electrolytes and water. Therefore, it is important for female athletes to consider applying a suitable nutritious diet and sufficient water consumption during Ramadan

TITLE: The Effect of Ramadan Fasting and Physical Activity on Body Composition, Serum Osmolarity Levels and Some Parameters of Electrolytes in Females    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  So far, there have been a few and incoherent results about the effects of physical activities. Fasting in Ramadan has an effect on the level of osmolarity and the concentration of serum electrolytes both in active and inactive females.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to observe the changes of serum electrolytes and osmolarity levels according to regular exercise during fasting.   ABSTRACT.PATIENTS AND METHODS.  Twenty two healthy females who were elected by convenience sampling method were divided into two groups: 1) fasting + exercise (fasting + exercise; n = 11) and 2) fasting + non exercise (fasting + non exercise; n = 15). The fasting + exercise group participated in aerobic training for four sessions per week during the fasting. All measurements were done once before the first day, on the second week, on the fourth week and two weeks after fasting month and these measures were used to analyze test results.

TITLE: I Can Stand Learning: A Controlled Pilot Intervention Study on the Effects of Increased Standing Time on Cognitive Function in Primary School Children    ABSTRACT.  Sedentarism is considered an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of employing standing desks in classrooms on cognitive function. The intervention class (IG; n = 19) was supplied with standing desks and balance pads for 11 weeks. The control class (CG; n = 19) received lessons as usual. Standing time was assessed objectively (accelerometers) and subjectively (self-report sheets, external classroom observers). The impact of standing on the digit span task and Eriksen flanker task was analysed. The intra-class correlation coefficient between self-reports and external observation was high (ICC = 0.94). The IG improved slightly on the Digit Span Task compared to CG. Employing standing desks for at least 1 h per school day serves as a feasible and effective opportunity to improve cognitive function.

TITLE: Polyethylene Glycol and Lactulose versus Lactulose Alone in the Treatment of Hepatic Encephalopathy in Patients with Cirrhosis: A Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.  BACKGROUND   In this clinical trial, polyethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol) solution was compared with lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis.    METHODS   This randomized controlled trial was performed on 40 patients in two groups. The patients in the lactulose group received either 20-30 grams of lactulose orally or by a nasogastric tube, or 200 grams of lactulose enema by a rectal tube. The patients in the polyethylene glycol–lactulose group received the same amount of oral or rectal lactulose, plus 280 grams of polyethylene glycol in 4 liters of water orally as a single dose in 30-120 minutes. Serial physical examinations, hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm (hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm), blood level of ammonia, and serum biochemical studies were used to evaluate the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.    RESULTS   In comparison with lactulose alone, PEG-lactulose could improve hepatic encephalopathy scoring algorithm score in 24 hours more effectively (p =0.04). CONCLUSION   The use of polyethylene glycol along with lactulose in comparison with lactulose alone is more effective in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis and results in more rapid discharge from hospital.

2	5525580	Total parenteral nutrition + Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines	The treatment protocol for all the participants followed the Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines, and group B received total parenteral nutrition containing 100 ml of Omega-3 fatty acids (containing 10 g refined fish oil) per day in addition to the standard treatment applied in group A. Group B had a significantly lower mortality rate compared with group A (12.5 vs. 41.7%, P<0.05) during the 28-day follow-up. TITLE: Single-blinded, randomized, and controlled clinical trial evaluating the effects of Omega-3 fatty acids among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction: A pilot study    ABSTRACT.  Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory reaction, which is aggravated by aspects of the immune response that are thought to be inhibited by Omega-3 fatty acids. The aim of the present study was to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid could modulate immunological function and improve survival rate among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction. A total of 48 mechanically ventilated patients with intestinal dysfunction were included in this prospective, randomized and single-blind clinical study. Patients were randomly divided into control (group A) and treatment groups (group B). Group B also had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (P<0.05) and lower Marshall scores (P<0.05) at day 7. In addition, group B had a higher ratio of T helper to inducer lymphocytes as well as a higher ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes (P<0.01 for both) than group A. It was concluded that Omega-3 fatty acids improved T helper/inducer and CD4/CD8 ratios, and may have reduced mortality, among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction.

The treatment protocol for all the participants followed the Sepsis Survival Campaign guidelines, and group B received total parenteral nutrition containing 100 ml of Omega-3 fatty acids (containing 10 g refined fish oil) per day in addition to the standard treatment applied in group A. Group B had a significantly lower mortality rate compared with group A (12.5 vs. 41.7%, P<0.05) during the 28-day follow-up. In addition, group B had a higher ratio of T helper to inducer lymphocytes as well as a higher ratio of CD4 to CD8 lymphocytes (P<0.01 for both) than group A. It was concluded that Omega-3 fatty acids improved T helper/inducer and CD4/CD8 ratios, and may have reduced mortality, among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction.

TITLE: Single-blinded, randomized, and controlled clinical trial evaluating the effects of Omega-3 fatty acids among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction: A pilot study    ABSTRACT.  Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory reaction, which is aggravated by aspects of the immune response that are thought to be inhibited by Omega-3 fatty acids. The aim of the present study was to determine if Omega-3 fatty acid could modulate immunological function and improve survival rate among septic patients with intestinal dysfunction.

TITLE: Ocular hypotensive effect of fixed-combination brinzolamide/brimonidine adjunctive to a prostaglandin analog: a randomized clinical trial    ABSTRACT.PURPOSE.  To determine whether intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure) lowering with fixed-combination brinzolamide/brimonidine (BBFC) adjunctive to a prostaglandin analog (prostaglandin analog) was superior to that of vehicle+PGA in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were inadequately controlled with prostaglandin analog monotherapy  ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group trial was conducted at 30 clinical sites in the United States between October 2013 and May 2014. Eligible patients were adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and with mean intraocular pressure ≥21 and <32 mm Hg, whereas receiving an open-label prostaglandin analog (latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost). Patients instilled a prostaglandin analog once-daily in a run-in phase before randomization to masked BBFC or vehicle adjunctive treatment. Masked treatments were instilled 3 times daily for 6 weeks, and patients continued once-daily use of their prostaglandin analog. The primary efficacy end point was the between-group difference in mean diurnal intraocular pressure (average of 0800, 1000, 1500, and 1700 hours time points) at week 6.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  BBFC+PGA reduced mean diurnal intraocular pressure by 5.7 mm Hg (25%) from the baseline intraocular pressure achieved with prostaglandin analog monotherapy.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Therapy with BBFC produced an additive IOP-lowering effect compared with a prostaglandin analog alone or in conjunction with vehicle. BBFC may provide an effective treatment option for patients receiving prostaglandin analog monotherapy who require additional intraocular pressure reduction.

2	3778304	Critical weight loss	The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates for patients with critical weight loss during radiotherapy were 62% and 82%, compared with 70% and 89% for patients without critical weight loss (P=0.01; P=0.001). TITLE: Critical weight loss is a major prognostic indicator for disease-specific survival in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND:.  Pre-treatment weight loss (weight loss) is a prognostic indicator for overall survival (overall survival) in head and neck cancer (head and neck cancer) patients. This study investigates the association between weight loss before or during radiotherapy and disease-specific survival (disease-specific survival) in head and neck cancer patients.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  In 1340 newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients, weight change was collected before and during (adjuvant) radiotherapy with curative intent. Critical weight loss during radiotherapy was defined as >5% weight loss during radiotherapy or >7.5% weight loss until week 12. Differences in 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival between weight loss groups were analysed by Cox's regression with adjustments for important socio-demographic and tumour-related confounders.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Before radiotherapy, 70% of patients had no weight loss, 16% had ⩽5% weight loss, 9% had >5–10% weight loss, and 5% had >10% weight loss. Five-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates for these groups were 71%, 59%, 47%, and 42% (P<0.001), and 86%, 86%, 81%, and 71%, respectively (P<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, >10% weight loss before radiotherapy remained significantly associated with a worse overall survival (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.5; P=0.002) and disease-specific survival (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2–3.5; P=0.007).   After adjustment, critical weight loss during radiotherapy remained significantly associated with a worse disease-specific survival (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2–2.4; P=0.004).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Weight loss both before and during radiotherapy are important prognostic indicators for 5-year disease-specific survival in head and neck cancer patients. Randomised studies into the prognostic effect of nutritional intervention are needed.

2	4723179	Sports Vision Training	The greatest effect was observed in near dissociated phoria (χ2 =14.56, p=0.001 for the right eye; χ2 =14.757, p=0.001 for the left eye) and fusional convergence (χ2 =8.522, p=0.014). TITLE: The Effects of Sports Vision Training on Binocular Vision Function in Female University Athletes    ABSTRACT.  Binocular vision is the most important visual cue for spatial orientation in many sports. In this study, we investigated how binocular vision was influenced by an eye training program that may be used to improve individual's oculomotor function. The experiment involved twenty-four female student athletes from team ball sports (soccer, basketball, handball). After an initial testing session, 12 participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group. Optometric investigation which included synoptophore testing and a test of dissociated horizontal phoria based on the Maddox method was performed three times: before the experiment, after eight weeks of eye training (3 times a week for 20 minutes), and four weeks after the experiment was terminated. Eye exercise methodology was based on orthoptic, sport and psychological aspects of performance. The phoria screening examination showed that exophoria was the most frequent disorder of binocular vision. Low fusional vergence range was also observed. Following the training period, 3 of the 6 oculomotor variables improved. The results of the retention test conducted four weeks after the experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the vision training program.

TITLE: The Effects of Sports Vision Training on Binocular Vision Function in Female University Athletes    ABSTRACT.  Binocular vision is the most important visual cue for spatial orientation in many sports. In this study, we investigated how binocular vision was influenced by an eye training program that may be used to improve individual's oculomotor function. The experiment involved twenty-four female student athletes from team ball sports (soccer, basketball, handball). After an initial testing session, 12 participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group. Optometric investigation which included synoptophore testing and a test of dissociated horizontal phoria based on the Maddox method was performed three times: before the experiment, after eight weeks of eye training (3 times a week for 20 minutes), and four weeks after the experiment was terminated. Eye exercise methodology was based on orthoptic, sport and psychological aspects of performance. The phoria screening examination showed that exophoria was the most frequent disorder of binocular vision. Low fusional vergence range was also observed. Following the training period, 3 of the 6 oculomotor variables improved. The results of the retention test conducted four weeks after the experiment confirmed the effectiveness of the vision training program. The results of the study suggest that binocular functions are trainable and can be improved by means of appropriate visual training.

2	4604314	Sodium nitrate supplementation in hypoxia	Nitrate supplementation further decreased muscle tissue oxygenation during 15 km time-trial cycling in hypoxia (p < 0.05). TITLE: Effect of oral nitrate supplementation on pulmonary hemodynamics during exercise and time trial performance in normoxia and hypoxia: a randomized controlled trial    ABSTRACT.  Background: Hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction increases pulmonary arterial pressure (pulmonary arterial pressure) and may impede right heart function and exercise performance. This study examined the effects of oral nitrate supplementation on right heart function and performance during exercise in normoxia and hypoxia. We tested the hypothesis that nitrate supplementation would attenuate the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure at rest and during exercise in hypoxia, thereby improving exercise performance.   Methods: Twelve trained male cyclists [age: 31 ± 7 year (mean ± SD)] performed 15 km time-trial cycling (time-trial cycling) and steady-state submaximal cycling (50, 100, and 150 W) in normoxia and hypoxia (11% inspired O2) following 3-day oral supplementation with either placebo or sodium nitrate (0.1 mmol/kg/day). We measured time-trial cycling time-to-completion, muscle tissue oxygenation during time-trial cycling and systolic right ventricle to right atrium pressure gradient (RV-RA gradient: index of pulmonary arterial pressure) during steady state cycling.   Results: During steady state exercise, hypoxia elevated RV-RA gradient (p > 0.05), while oral nitrate supplementation did not alter RV-RA gradient (p > 0.05). During 15 km time-trial cycling, hypoxia lowered muscle tissue oxygenation (p < 0.05). Hypoxia impaired time-to-completion during time-trial cycling (p < 0.05), while no improvements were observed with nitrate supplementation in normoxia or hypoxia (p > 0.05).   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that oral nitrate supplementation does not attenuate acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction nor improve performance during time trial cycling in normoxia and hypoxia.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of maintenance system as well as the effect of Se, ZnSO4, and vitamin E supplementation of ram-lambs on the slaughter value and concentration of mineral elements in the loin muscle of lambs. The experiment was conducted on 72 Polish Merino ram-lambs divided into three groups: group C, indoor with no supplement, 19 lambs; S, indoor with supplement, 23 lambs; G, outdoor with no supplement, 30 lambs. From birth all the lambs were maintained indoor with their dams and then weaned at the age of 8 weeks. The rams from group C and S were placed in individual straw-bedded pens and fattened individually with concentrate mixture offered ad libitum until the age of 16 weeks. The lambs from group G were grazed every day from May to July (2 months). During the fattening period each lamb from the supplemented group S was administered per os 1 mL 0.1% Na2SeO4 (Se, 0.42 mg), 3 mL 10% ZnSO4 (ZnSO4, 68 mg), and 1 mL premix protect vitamin E (0.1 g α-tocopherol, 5 mg lysine, 5 mg methionine) daily. The meat content in the pelvic limb showed no differences across all groups under study. The pelvic limb of grazing lambs contained less fat compared to the control and supplemented groups (p<0.001). The concentrations of Se and ZnSO4 in the blood plasma of ram-lambs from the supplemented group were significantly higher than for the control and grazing lambs. Inorganic Se and ZnSO4 supplementation with vitamin E to the diet of lambs increased Se and ZnSO4 levels in loin muscle (p<0.001) to 0.46 μg/g and 32.9 μg/g in fresh tissue, respectively.

During the fattening period each lamb from the supplemented group S was administered per os 1 mL 0.1% Na2SeO4 (Se, 0.42 mg), 3 mL 10% ZnSO4 (ZnSO4, 68 mg), and 1 mL premix protect vitamin E (0.1 g α-tocopherol, 5 mg lysine, 5 mg methionine) daily. The meat content in the pelvic limb showed no differences across all groups under study. The pelvic limb of grazing lambs contained less fat compared to the control and supplemented groups (p<0.001). The concentrations of Se and ZnSO4 in the blood plasma of ram-lambs from the supplemented group were significantly higher than for the control and grazing lambs. Inorganic Se and ZnSO4 supplementation with vitamin E to the diet of lambs increased Se and ZnSO4 levels in loin muscle (p<0.001) to 0.46 μg/g and 32.9 μg/g in fresh tissue, respectively.

TITLE: Effect of     ABSTRACT.   Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the most crucial disorders among multiple sclerosis (multiple sclerosis) patients. Since multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease and Boswellia papyrifera has anti-inflammatory effects, the influence of B. papyrifera on cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis patients has been investigated in the present study.    Methods: In this clinical trial, 80 multiple sclerosis patients who referred to the clinic of Shafa Hospital, Kerman, Iran were selected. Having completed a written consent form, patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, with no occurrence of a new attack throughout 1 month before the study, with no pregnancy or breastfeeding entered the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups; then Brief International Cognitive Assessment for multiple sclerosis (Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS) test was carried out. One group received B. papyrifera (capsule 300 mg, twice a day) while the other group received placebo with the same dose for 2 months. After 2 months of treatment, Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS was redone and changes were analyzed. The significant change value on the before-after Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS points were considered to be 8, 13, and 7 points for the symbol digit modality test (symbol digit modality test), the California verbal learning test (California verbal learning test), and the brief visual-spatial memory test revised (brief visual-spatial memory test revised), respectively.    Results: The patients' mean age was 36.58 8.50 years. The mean duration of disease was 7.41 4.13 years. About 84.2% (n = 64) of the patients was female. Conclusion:  B. papyrifera showed significant improvement in visuospatial memory, but had no effect on verbal memory and information processing speed.

TITLE: New pre-arrival instructions can avoid abdominal hand placement for chest compressions    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To investigate if modified pre-arrival instructions using patient's arm and nipple line as landmarks could avoid abdominal hand placements for chest compressions.   ABSTRACT.METHOD.  Volunteers were randomized to one of two telephone instructions: "Kneel down beside the chest. Place one hand in the centre of the victim's chest and the other on top" (control) or "Lay the patient's arm which is closest to you, straight out from the body. Kneel down by the patient and place one knee on each side of the arm. Find the midpoint between the nipples and place your hands on top of each other" (intervention). Hand placement was conducted on an adult male and documented by laser measurements. Hand placement, quantified as the centre of the compressing hands in the mid-sagittal plane, was compared to the inter-nipple line (inter-nipple line) for reference and classified as above or below. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of proportions.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Thirty-six lay people, age range 16–60, were included. Using inter-nipple line as a reference, the new instructions resulted in less caudal hand placement, and the difference in mean hand position was 47 mm [95% CI 21,73], p = 0.001.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  New pre-arrival instructions where the patient's arm and nipple line were used as landmarks resulted in less caudal hand placements and none in the abdominal region.

TITLE: Effects of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor evacetrapib on lipoproteins, apolipoproteins and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in healthy adults    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  We investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of evacetrapib.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Healthy volunteers received multiple daily doses of evacetrapib (10–600 mg) administered for up to 15 days in a placebo-controlled study.   ABSTRACT.KEY FINDINGS.  Mean peak plasma concentrations of evacetrapib occurred at 4–6 h and terminal half-life ranged 24–44 h. Steady state was achieved at approximately 10 days; all subjects had undetectable levels of evacetrapib 3 weeks after their last dose. The trough inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) activity was 65 and 84% at 100 and 300 mg, respectively. For the highest dose tested, levels of evacetrapib, cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, cholesteryl ester transfer protein mass, HDL-C and LDL-C returned to levels at or near baseline after a 2-week washout period. Evacetrapib at the highest dose tested did not produce any significant effect on 24-h ambulatory systolic or diastolic blood pressure.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Multiple doses of evacetrapib potently inhibited cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, leading to substantial elevations in HDL-C and lowering of LDL-C. Evacetrapib was devoid of clinically relevant effects on blood pressure and mineralocorticoid levels.

TITLE: Comparative utility of disability progression measures in primary progressive MS    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE:. To assess the comparative utility of disability progression measures in primary progressive MS (primary progressive MS) using the PROMiSe trial data set.   ABSTRACT.METHODS:.  Data for patients randomized to placebo (n = 316) in the PROMiSe trial were included in this analysis. Disability was assessed using change in single (Expanded Disability Status Scale [Expanded Disability Status Scale], timed 25-foot walk [timed 25-foot walk], and 9-hole peg test [9-hole peg test]) and composite disability measures (EDSS/T25FW, EDSS/9HPT, and EDSS/T25FW/9HPT). Cumulative and cross-sectional unconfirmed disability progression (unconfirmed disability progression) and confirmed disability progression (confirmed disability progression; sustained for 3 months) rates were assessed at 12 and 24 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. confirmed disability progression rates defined by a ≥20% increase in timed 25-foot walk were higher than those defined by Expanded Disability Status Scale score at 12 and 24 months. The 3-part composite measure was associated with more confirmed disability progression events (41.4% and 63.9% of patients at 12 and 24 months, respectively) than the 2-part measure (EDSS/T25FW [38.5% and 59.5%, respectively]) and any single measure. Cumulative unconfirmed disability progression and confirmed disability progression rates were higher than cross-sectional rates.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  The timed 25-foot walk or composite measures of disability may be more sensitive to disability progression in patients with primary progressive MS and should be considered as the primary endpoint for future studies of new therapies. confirmed disability progression may be the preferred measure in classic randomized controlled trials in which cumulative disability progression rates are evaluated; unconfirmed disability progression may be feasible for cross-sectional studies.

Disability was assessed using change in single (Expanded Disability Status Scale [Expanded Disability Status Scale], timed 25-foot walk [timed 25-foot walk], and 9-hole peg test [9-hole peg test]) and composite disability measures (EDSS/T25FW, EDSS/9HPT, and EDSS/T25FW/9HPT). Cumulative and cross-sectional unconfirmed disability progression (unconfirmed disability progression) and confirmed disability progression (confirmed disability progression; sustained for 3 months) rates were assessed at 12 and 24 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:. confirmed disability progression rates defined by a ≥20% increase in timed 25-foot walk were higher than those defined by Expanded Disability Status Scale score at 12 and 24 months. The 3-part composite measure was associated with more confirmed disability progression events (41.4% and 63.9% of patients at 12 and 24 months, respectively) than the 2-part measure (EDSS/T25FW [38.5% and 59.5%, respectively]) and any single measure. Cumulative unconfirmed disability progression and confirmed disability progression rates were higher than cross-sectional rates.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS:.  The timed 25-foot walk or composite measures of disability may be more sensitive to disability progression in patients with primary progressive MS and should be considered as the primary endpoint for future studies of new therapies. confirmed disability progression may be the preferred measure in classic randomized controlled trials in which cumulative disability progression rates are evaluated; unconfirmed disability progression may be feasible for cross-sectional studies.

TITLE: Bilateral Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Improves Lower‐Limb Motor Function in Subjects With Chronic Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) has been used to augment the efficacy of task‐oriented training (task‐oriented training) after stroke. Bilateral intervention approaches have also been shown to be effective in augmenting motor function after stroke. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of bilateral Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with task‐oriented training versus unilateral Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with task‐oriented training in improving lower‐limb motor function in subjects with chronic stroke.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.  Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to bilateral TENS+TOT or to unilateral TENS+TOT and underwent 20 sessions of training over a 10‐week period. The outcome measures included the maximal strength of the lower‐limb muscles and the results of the Lower Extremity Motor Coordination Test, Berg Balance Scale, Step Test, and Timed Up and Go test. Each participant was assessed at baseline, after 10 and 20 sessions of training and 3 months after the cessation of training. However, there were no significant between‐group differences for other outcome measures.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The application of bilateral Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation over the common peroneal nerve combined with task‐oriented training was superior to the application of unilateral Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation combined with task‐oriented training in improving paretic ankle dorsiflexion strength after 10 sessions of training and in improving the completion time for the Timed Up and Go test after 20 sessions of training.

2	4396724	High-intensity interval training	Minutes spent in vigorous physical activity per week measured by accelerometer were higher in High-intensity interval training (24 ± 18) as compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (11 ± 10) at one-month follow-up (P = 0.049, Cohen's d = 0.92). TITLE:  High-Intensity Interval Training as an Efficacious Alternative to Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training for Adults with Prediabetes    ABSTRACT.   Aims. High-intensity interval training (High-intensity interval training) leads to improvements in various markers of cardiometabolic health but adherence to High-intensity interval training following a supervised laboratory intervention has yet to be tested. We compared self-report and objective measures of physical activity after one month of independent exercise in individuals with prediabetes who were randomized to High-intensity interval training (n = 15) or traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (moderate-intensity continuous training, n = 17). Method. After completing 10 sessions of supervised training participants were asked to perform High-intensity interval training or moderate-intensity continuous training three times per week for four weeks. Results. Individuals in High-intensity interval training (89 ± 11%) adhered to their prescribed protocol to a greater extent than individuals in moderate-intensity continuous training (71 ± 31%) as determined by training logs completed over one-month follow-up (P = 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.75). Cardiorespiratory fitness and systolic blood pressure assessed at one-month follow-up were equally improved (P's < 0.05). Conclusions. This study provides preliminary evidence that individuals with prediabetes can adhere to High-intensity interval training over the short-term and do so at a level that is greater than moderate-intensity continuous training.

However, both cleavage and blastocyst rates were lower (P < 0.001) in the Vitrified group than in the Control, vitrification solution 1 and vitrification solution 1 + VS2 groups (40.9 and 1.6% vs 92.2 and 34.4%, 79.4 and 25.2%, and 80.2 and 20.8%, respectively in Experiment 1, and 25.0 and 1.7% vs 75.3 and 27.2%, 67.9 and 19.5%, and 62.7 and 22.5%, respectively in Experiment 2).   TITLE: Vitrification of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes: effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and warming time on cleavage and embryo development    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  The present studies evaluated the effects of cryoprotectants, the vitrification procedure and time in the warming solution containing sucrose on cleavage and embryo development of immature (GV stage) bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (cumulus-oocyte complexes).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, cumulus-oocyte complexes (n = 420) were randomly assigned to four groups: 1) Control group: no treatment; 2) vitrification solution 1 group: cumulus-oocyte complexes were exposed to vitrification solution 1 (vitrification solution 1) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol [ethylene glycol] + 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [dimethyl sulfoxide] + 20% calf serum [calf serum] in TCM-199 at 37 C for 5 min; 3) vitrification solution 1 + VS2 group: cumulus-oocyte complexes were exposed to vitrification solution 1 for 5 min followed by VS2 (15% ethylene glycol + 15% dimethyl sulfoxide + 17.1% sucrose + 20% calf serum) at 37 C for 45–60 sec; and 4) Vitrified group: cumulus-oocyte complexes were exposed to vitrification solution 1 and VS2, loaded on cryotops, vitrified in liquid nitrogen and then warmed in TCM-199 + 17.1% sucrose + 20% calf serum at 37 C for 1 min. In Experiment 2, cumulus-oocyte complexes (n = 581) were assigned to the same groups, but those in vitrification solution 1, vitrification solution 1 + VS2 and Vitrified groups were sub-divided and exposed to the warming solution for either 1 or 5 min. After treatment and/or warming, all cumulus-oocyte complexes in both experiments underwent in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization and in vitro culture.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ among Control, vitrification solution 1 and vitrification solution 1 + VS2 groups in either experiment. In Experiment 2, there was no effect of time in the warming solution.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The permeating cryoprotectants (ethylene glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide) present in vitrification solution 1 and VS2 solutions and the time in the warming solution containing sucrose had no adverse effects on cleavage and blastocyst rates of immature bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes. However, cleavage rate and early embryo development were reduced following the vitrification and warming.

2	4837927	Kinesio taping	Pain intensity and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores improved significantly in both groups at 5 days compared with baseline. Considering the degree of treatment effect (the change from baseline to day 5), the Kinesio taping group was significantly superior than the control group in all outcome measures (for all, P<0.001).   TITLE: Short-Term Effects of Kinesio Taping in Women with Pregnancy-Related Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common condition during pregnancy. Kinesio tape is a drug-free elastic therapeutic tape used for treating various musculoskeletal problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of lumbar Kinesio taping on pain intensity and disability in women with pregnancy-related low back pain.   ABSTRACT.MATERIAL/METHODS.  A total of 65 patients with pregnancy-related low back pain were randomly allocated into either Kinesio taping (n=33) or control (n=32) groups. The intervention group was treated with paracetamol plus Kinesio taping, while the control group received only paracetamol. Kinesio taping was applied in the lumbar flexion position, and four I-shaped bands were used. Two bands were attached horizontally, with space correction technique. The remaining 2 bands, 1 on each side of the lumbar spine, were placed vertically, with inhibition technique. Low back pain intensity was measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (visual analogue scale), and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) was used for evaluation of disability.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  The results of this study indicate that Kinesio taping can be used as a complementary treatment method to achieve effective control of pregnancy-related low back pain.

TITLE: The efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile comparing immediate loading implants to delayed loading implants: A comparative clinical study    ABSTRACT.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES.  To assess the efficacy of flapless implant surgery on soft-tissue profile and to compare the clinical outcomes of flapless implant therapy on immediate loading (immediate loading) implants to delayed loading (delayed loading) implants.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS.  The study sample consisted of 20 patients who were partially edentulous in the anterior maxillary region. They were divided into two groups. In group I (immediate loading) 10 implants were placed and immediately provisionalized and restored with a metal ceramic crown on the 14th day. In group II (delayed loading) 10 implants were placed and loaded after 4 months. Single-piece implants were used for the immediate loading group and two-piece implants were used for the delayed loading group. All soft tissue parameters i.e., modified plaque index (modified plaque index), modified bleeding index (modified bleeding index), papillary index (papillary index), marginal level of soft tissue (ML) and width of keratinized mucosa (width of keratinized mucosa) were recorded at baseline, Day 60, Day 120 and Day 180.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  There was no statistically significant difference between the groups over time in parameters like modified plaque index, modified bleeding index, ML and width of keratinized mucosa. The mean papillary index score in group II showed a significant increase from when compared to group I.  ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  The results of this study indicated that flapless implant surgery using either immediately loading implants or delayed loading implants, demonstrate enhancement of implant esthetics.

2	1187893	Exercise	In the exercise group, an improvement was seen at 6 weeks in the KOOS subscale quality of life compared to the control group (mean change 4.0 vs. -0.7, p = 0.05). The difference between groups was still persistent at 6 months (p = 0.02).   TITLE: Six-week high-intensity exercise program for middle-aged patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial [ISRCTN20244858]    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Studies on exercise in knee osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis) have focused on elderly subjects. Subjects in this study were middle-aged with symptomatic and definite radiographic knee osteoarthritis. The aim was to test the effects of a short-term, high-intensity exercise program on self-reported pain, function and quality of life.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients aged 36–65, with osteoarthritis grade III (Kellgren & Lawrence) were recruited. They had been referred for radiographic examination due to knee pain and had no history of major knee injury. They were randomized to a twice weekly supervised one hour exercise intervention for six weeks, or to a non-intervention control group. Exercise was performed at ≥ 60% of maximum heart rate (HR max). The primary outcome measure was the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Follow-up occurred at 6 weeks and 6 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Sixty-one subjects (mean age 56 (SD 6), 51 % women, mean BMI 29.5 (SD 4.8)) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 30) or control group (n = 31). No significant differences in the KOOS subscales assessing pain, other symptoms, or function in daily life or in sport and recreation were seen at any time point between exercisers and controls. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  A six-week high-intensive exercise program had no effect on pain or function in middle-aged patients with moderate to severe radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Some effect was seen on quality of life in the exercise group compared to the control group.

The primary outcome measure was the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Follow-up occurred at 6 weeks and 6 months.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Sixty-one subjects (mean age 56 (SD 6), 51 % women, mean BMI 29.5 (SD 4.8)) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 30) or control group (n = 31). No significant differences in the KOOS subscales assessing pain, other symptoms, or function in daily life or in sport and recreation were seen at any time point between exercisers and controls. ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  A six-week high-intensive exercise program had no effect on pain or function in middle-aged patients with moderate to severe radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Some effect was seen on quality of life in the exercise group compared to the control group.

2	4026558	Whole-body vibration	After 3 months, there were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate in both groups. TITLE: Effect of whole-body vibration for 3 months on arterial stiffness in the middle-aged and elderly    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Cardiovascular disease (Cardiovascular disease) is a common problem of middle-aged and older adults. Increased arterial stiffness is a Cardiovascular disease risk factor. Whole-body vibration (Whole-body vibration) is a simple and convenient exercise for middle-aged and older adults; however, there have been few studies investigating the effect of Whole-body vibration on arterial stiffness. This study mainly investigated the effect of Whole-body vibration on arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  A total of 38 (21 women and 17 men) middle-aged and elderly subjects (average age, 61.9 years) were randomly divided into the Whole-body vibration group and the control group for a 3-month trial. The Whole-body vibration group received an intervention of 30 Hz and 3.2 g Whole-body vibration in a natural full standing posture at a sports center. The brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity (brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity), a marker of systemic arterial stiffness, and blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after the intervention.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  However, the bilateral brachial–ankle pulse wave velocity was significantly reduced in the Whole-body vibration group (decreased by 0.65 m/second [P=0.014]; 0.63 m/second [P=0.041] in either side), but not in the control group. The comparison between the two groups was not statistically significant.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  This study found that 3 months of Whole-body vibration had a positive effect on arterial stiffness in middle-aged and older adults and could therefore be regarded as a supplementary exercise. Larger-scale studies are needed to confirm the effects of Whole-body vibration in the future.

2	4045752	paracetamol for 6 hours after (therapeutic use) vaccination	The anti-HBs level in the therapeutic paracetamol group (4958 mIU/mL) was not different (p = 0.34) from the level in the control group. TITLE: Effects of Prophylactic and Therapeutic Paracetamol Treatment during Vaccination on Hepatitis B Antibody Levels in Adults: Two Open-Label, Randomized Controlled Trials    ABSTRACT.  Worldwide, paracetamol is administered as a remedy for complaints that occur after vaccination. Recently published results indicate that paracetamol inhibits the vaccination response in infants when given prior to vaccination. The goal of this study was to establish whether paracetamol exerts similar effects in young adults. In addition, the effect of timing of paracetamol intake was investigated. In two randomized, controlled, open-label studies 496 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to three groups. The study groups received paracetamol for 24 hours starting at the time of (prophylactic use) - or 6 hours after (therapeutic use) the primary (0 month) and first booster (1 month) hepatitis B vaccination. The control group received no paracetamol. None of the participants used paracetamol around the second booster (6 months) vaccination. Anti-HBs levels were measured prior to and one month after the second booster vaccination on ADVIA Centaur XP. One month after the second booster vaccination, the anti-HBs level in the prophylactic paracetamol group was significantly lower (p = 0.048) than the level in the control group (4257 mIU/mL vs. 5768 mIU/mL). Only prophylactic paracetamol treatment, and not therapeutic treatment, during vaccination has a negative influence on the antibody concentration after hepatitis B vaccination in adults. These findings prompt to consider therapeutic instead of prophylactic treatment to ensure maximal vaccination efficacy and retain the possibility to treat pain and fever after vaccination.

TITLE: Effects of different doses of sufentanil and remifentanil combined with propofol in target-controlled infusion on stress reaction in elderly patients    ABSTRACT.  The current study aimed to observe the effects of sufentanil and remifentanil combined with propofol in target-controlled infusion (target-controlled infusion) on perioperative stress reaction in elderly patients. A total of 80 elderly patients requiring general anesthesia were recruited. They were divided into four groups (each n=20) according to different target concentrations of remifentanil and sufentanil. These target concentrations were: 4 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for group I; 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.3 ng/ml sufentanil for group II; 2 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.5 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group III; and 5 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 4 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group IV. Norepinephrine (Norepinephrine), epinephrine (epinephrine) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in plasma were measured prior to the induction of anesthesia, as well as at several different time-points following surgery. The numbers of intraoperative severe hemodynamic fluctuation, postoperative eye-opening and extubation time, and post-extubation restlessness and pain scores were recorded. Group IV had a larger circulation fluctuation control number and higher levels of Norepinephrine, epinephrine and Ang II at 3 h after surgery than any other group (P<0.01). The combined use of sufentanil and remifentanil stabilizes perioperative hemodynamics and reduces stress hormone levels.

These target concentrations were: 4 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for group I; 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.3 ng/ml sufentanil for group II; 2 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.5 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 3 ng/ml remifentanil + 0.2 ng/ml sufentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group III; and 5 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia induction and post-intubation 4 ng/ml remifentanil for anesthesia maintenance for group IV. Norepinephrine (Norepinephrine), epinephrine (epinephrine) and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in plasma were measured prior to the induction of anesthesia, as well as at several different time-points following surgery. The numbers of intraoperative severe hemodynamic fluctuation, postoperative eye-opening and extubation time, and post-extubation restlessness and pain scores were recorded. Group IV had a larger circulation fluctuation control number and higher levels of Norepinephrine, epinephrine and Ang II at 3 h after surgery than any other group (P<0.01). The combined use of sufentanil and remifentanil stabilizes perioperative hemodynamics and reduces stress hormone levels.

2	2708184	Body-weight supported treadmill training combined with Lokomat	No significant differences in primary outcomes were revealed between Lokomat and manual groups as a result of training. TITLE: Pilot study of Lokomat versus manual-assisted treadmill training for locomotor recovery post-stroke    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  While manually-assisted body-weight supported treadmill training (body-weight supported treadmill training) has revealed improved locomotor function in persons with post-stroke hemiparesis, outcomes are inconsistent and it is very labor intensive. Thus an alternate treatment approach is desirable. Objectives of this pilot study were to: 1) compare the efficacy of body-weight supported treadmill training (body-weight supported treadmill training) combined with the Lokomat robotic gait orthosis versus manually-assisted body-weight supported treadmill training for locomotor training post-stroke, and 2) assess effects of fast versus slow treadmill training speed.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Sixteen volunteers with chronic hemiparetic gait (0.62 ± 0.30 m/s) post-stroke were randomly allocated to Lokomat (n = 8) or manual-BWSTT (n = 8) 3×/wk for 4 weeks. Groups were also stratified by fast (mean 0.92 ± 0.15 m/s) or slow (0.58 ± 0.12 m/s) training speeds. The primary outcomes were self-selected overground walking speed and paretic step length ratio. Secondary outcomes included: fast overground walking speed, 6-minute walk test, and a battery of clinical measures.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  However, within the Lokomat group, self-selected walk speed, paretic step length ratio, and four of the six secondary measures improved (p = 0.04–0.05, effect sizes = 0.19–0.60). Within the manual group, only balance scores improved (p = 0.02, effect size = 0.57). Group differences between fast and slow training groups were not revealed (p ≥ 0.28).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Results suggest that Lokomat training may have advantages over manual-BWSTT following a modest intervention dose in chronic hemiparetic persons and further, that our training speeds produce similar gait improvements. Suggestions for a larger randomized controlled trial with optimal study parameters are provided.

2	4673714	Pitavastatin	After the 12-months treatment period, LDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in the diet-plus-statin therapy group compared with the diet therapy group (diet vs diet-plus-statin: LDL-cholesterol, 126 ± 5 vs 83 ± 4 mg/dL, P < 0.001). TITLE: Effects of pitavastatin add-on therapy on chronic kidney disease with albuminuria and dyslipidemia    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  In non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is recommended to prevent cardiovascular complications. Dyslipidemia has been also shown to be an independent risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, it is still unclear whether statin therapy exerts an inhibitory effect on renal deterioration in chronic kidney disease patients with dyslipidemia. The purpose of the present study was to examine possible therapeutic effects of statin add-on therapy on renal function as well as parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism, arterial stiffness and oxidative stress, in comparison to diet therapy, in chronic kidney disease patients with dyslipidemia.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This study was a randomized, open-label, and parallel-group trial consisted of a 12-months treatment period in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients with alubuminuria and dyslipidemia. Twenty eight patients were randomly assigned either to receive diet counseling alone (diet therapy group) or diet counseling plus pitavastatin (diet-plus-statin therapy group), to achieve the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) target of <100 mg/dl.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The statin treatment by pitavastatin was well tolerated in all of the patients without any significant adverse events and the average dose of pitavastatin was 1.0 ± 0.0 mg daily after treatment. On the other hand, the diet-plus-statin therapy did not significantly reduce albuminuria or delay the decline in eGFR compared with the diet therapy, and there was no relationship between the change in LDL-cholesterol and the change in eGFR or albuminuria. However, diet therapy as well as diet-plus-statin therapy exerted similar lowering effects on the pentosidine levels (diet therapy group, baseline vs 12 months: 40 ± 4 vs 24 ± 3 ng/mL, P = 0.001; diet-plus-statin therapy, 46 ± 7 vs 34 ± 6 ng/mL, P = 0.008). Furthermore, the results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that the change in pentosidine was a significant contributor to the change in eGFR (β = −0.536, P = 0.011).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Although statin add-on therapy did not show additive renal protective effects, the diet therapy as well as the diet-plus-statin therapy could contribute to the reduction in plasma pentosidine in chronic kidney disease patients with albuminuria and dyslipidemia.

1	4673714	Control	Twenty eight patients were randomly assigned either to receive diet counseling alone (diet therapy group) or diet counseling plus pitavastatin (diet-plus-statin therapy group), to achieve the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) target of <100 mg/dl.   TITLE: Effects of pitavastatin add-on therapy on chronic kidney disease with albuminuria and dyslipidemia    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  In non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is recommended to prevent cardiovascular complications. Dyslipidemia has been also shown to be an independent risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, it is still unclear whether statin therapy exerts an inhibitory effect on renal deterioration in chronic kidney disease patients with dyslipidemia. The purpose of the present study was to examine possible therapeutic effects of statin add-on therapy on renal function as well as parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism, arterial stiffness and oxidative stress, in comparison to diet therapy, in chronic kidney disease patients with dyslipidemia.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  This study was a randomized, open-label, and parallel-group trial consisted of a 12-months treatment period in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients with alubuminuria and dyslipidemia. ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  The statin treatment by pitavastatin was well tolerated in all of the patients without any significant adverse events and the average dose of pitavastatin was 1.0 ± 0.0 mg daily after treatment. After the 12-months treatment period, LDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in the diet-plus-statin therapy group compared with the diet therapy group (diet vs diet-plus-statin: LDL-cholesterol, 126 ± 5 vs 83 ± 4 mg/dL, P < 0.001). On the other hand, the diet-plus-statin therapy did not significantly reduce albuminuria or delay the decline in eGFR compared with the diet therapy, and there was no relationship between the change in LDL-cholesterol and the change in eGFR or albuminuria. However, diet therapy as well as diet-plus-statin therapy exerted similar lowering effects on the pentosidine levels (diet therapy group, baseline vs 12 months: 40 ± 4 vs 24 ± 3 ng/mL, P = 0.001; diet-plus-statin therapy, 46 ± 7 vs 34 ± 6 ng/mL, P = 0.008). Furthermore, the results of multivariate regression analysis indicated that the change in pentosidine was a significant contributor to the change in eGFR (β = −0.536, P = 0.011).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  Although statin add-on therapy did not show additive renal protective effects, the diet therapy as well as the diet-plus-statin therapy could contribute to the reduction in plasma pentosidine in chronic kidney disease patients with albuminuria and dyslipidemia.

TITLE: High frequency chest wall oscillation for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  High frequency chest wall oscillation (High frequency chest wall oscillation) is used for airway mucus clearance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of High frequency chest wall oscillation early in the treatment of adults hospitalized for acute asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Randomized, multi-center, double-masked phase II clinical trial of active or sham treatment initiated within 24 hours of hospital admission for acute asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at four academic medical centers. Patients received active or sham treatment for 15 minutes three times a day for four treatments. Medical management was standardized across groups. The primary outcomes were patient adherence to therapy after four treatments (minutes used/60 minutes prescribed) and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included change in Borg dyspnea score (≥ 1 unit indicates a clinically significant change), spontaneously expectorated sputum volume, and forced expired volume in 1 second.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Fifty-two participants were randomized to active (n = 25) or sham (n = 27) treatment. Patient satisfaction was also similarly high in both groups. After four treatments, a higher proportion of patients in the active treatment group had a clinically significant improvement in dyspnea (70.8% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  High frequency chest wall oscillation is well tolerated in adults hospitalized for acute asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and significantly improves dyspnea. The high levels of patient satisfaction in both treatment groups justify the need for sham controls when evaluating the use of High frequency chest wall oscillation on patient-reported outcomes. Additional studies are needed to more fully evaluate the role of High frequency chest wall oscillation in improving in-hospital and post-discharge outcomes in this population.

TITLE: Comparison of anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin with rosuvastatin in patients of acute coronary syndrome    ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES:. To compare anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in patients of acute coronary syndrome.   ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS:.  The study was a prospective, open-labeled, randomized and single-center study conducted on 100 patients of acute coronary syndrome. Patients were assigned to atorvastatin 40 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily for 4 weeks. C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) levels, lipid profiles, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and adverse effects were measured at beginning and at the end of 4 weeks.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Baseline parameters and clinical profile did not differ between the two groups. However, there was significant difference between the levels of C-reactive protein in patients of the rosuvastatin group as compared to the atorvastatin group (19.91 ± 6.32 vs 23.07 ± 7.47, P < 0.05). In addition, both the drugs were associated with a reduction in total cholesterol, LDL levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the end of 4 weeks as compared to the beginning (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Both atorvastatin (40 mg) and rosuvastatin (20 mg) are effective in decreasing C-reactive protein and LDL cholesterol levels even in a short duration of 4 weeks. Rosuvastatin was found to be more effective in decreasing C-reactive protein levels.

C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) levels, lipid profiles, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and adverse effects were measured at beginning and at the end of 4 weeks.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS:.  Baseline parameters and clinical profile did not differ between the two groups. C-reactive protein levels significantly decreased from beginning to the end of 4 weeks in both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin groups (from 35.48 to 23.07 mg/l and from 35.88 to 19.91 mg/l respectively, both P < 0.001). In addition, both the drugs were associated with a reduction in total cholesterol, LDL levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the end of 4 weeks as compared to the beginning (P < 0.001 for all comparisons).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION:.  Both atorvastatin (40 mg) and rosuvastatin (20 mg) are effective in decreasing C-reactive protein and LDL cholesterol levels even in a short duration of 4 weeks. Rosuvastatin was found to be more effective in decreasing C-reactive protein levels.

TITLE: Intravitreal ziv-aflibercept for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion    ABSTRACT.AIM.  To report the efficacy of intravitreal ziv-aflibercept injections in eyes with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusions (retinal vein occlusions).   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Consecutive patients with persistent or recurrent macular edema (central macula thickness >250 μm) due to RVO were enrolled in this prospective study. Study eyes received intravitreal injections of ziv-aflibercept (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) at baseline. Patients were reassessed monthly for 4 months and given additional injections pro re nata for worsening best-corrected visual acuity (best-corrected visual acuity), intraretinal edema or subretinal fluid seen on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or central macular thickness (central macular thickness) measurements >250 μm. The primary endpoint was improvement in mean central macular thickness at 4 months. Secondary endpoints included improvement in mean best-corrected visual acuity, and ocular and systemic safety signals.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Nine eyes (five central and four branch retinal vein occlusions) of nine patients were enrolled. The mean best-corrected visual acuity did not improve significantly from baseline (1.00 LogMAR) to the 1-month (0.74 LogMAR; P=0.2) and 4-month (0.71 LogMAR; P=0.13) visits. No safety signals were noted.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In this small prospective study, intravitreal ziv-aflibercept significantly improved mean central macular thickness in eyes with persistent or recurrent macular edema due to retinal vein occlusions. Prospective, randomized trials comparing ziv-aflibercept with standard pharmacotherapy are needed to better define efficacy and safety.

2	5587697	Stress condition	Additionally, stress effects varied as a function of impulsivity traits. Individuals who lacked perseverance (i.e., had difficulty focusing on a difficult or boring task) gambled more after experiencing a loss in the stress condition than did those in the control condition. TITLE: Impulsivity influences betting under stress in laboratory gambling    ABSTRACT.  Although recent research suggests that acute stress influences subsequent decision-making under ambiguity, less is known about the role of personality variables in this relationship. This study tested whether impulsivity traits and acute stress differentially influence the way in which a prior feedback is incorporated into further decisions involving ambiguity. Sixty college students (50% male; aged 18–25 years) were randomly assigned to a stress versus a non-stress condition before completing a laboratory gambling task. The results revealed that independently of the stress condition, subjects behaved as if the odds of winning increase after a single loss. The present study supports that impulsivity traits can explain the differential effect of stress on the relationship between prior feedback and choices made under ambiguity.

TITLE: Ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome with or without revascularization: results from the PLATO trial    ABSTRACT.AIMS.  The optimal platelet inhibition strategy for ACS patients managed without revascularization is unknown.   We aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel in the non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome) subgroup of the PLATO trial, in the total cohort, and in the subgroups managed with and without revascularization within 10 days of randomization.   ABSTRACT.METHODS AND RESULTS.  We performed a retrospective analysis of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/stroke. Among 18 624 PLATO patients, 11 080 (59%) were categorized as non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome at randomization. During the initial 10 days, 74% had angiography, 46% PCI, and 5% CABG. In non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients, the primary endpoint was reduced with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel [10.0 vs. 12.3%; hazard ratio (hazard ratio) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (confidence interval) = 0.74–0.93], as was myocardial infarction (6.6 vs. 7.7%; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.74–0.99), cardiovascular death (3.7 vs. 4.9%; hazard ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval = 0.64–0.93), and all-cause death (4.3 vs. 5.8%; hazard ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval = 0.64–0.90). Within the first 10 days, 5366 (48.4%) patients were managed without revascularization. Regardless of revascularization or not, ticagrelor consistently reduced the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.86 vs. 0.85, interaction P = 0.93), and all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.75 vs. 0.73, interaction P = 0.89) with no significant increase in overall major bleeding.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, benefit of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing ischaemic events and total mortality was consistent with the overall PLATO trial, independent of actually performed revascularization during the initial 10 days.

In non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients, the primary endpoint was reduced with ticagrelor vs. clopidogrel [10.0 vs. 12.3%; hazard ratio (hazard ratio) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (confidence interval) = 0.74–0.93], as was myocardial infarction (6.6 vs. 7.7%; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.74–0.99), cardiovascular death (3.7 vs. 4.9%; hazard ratio 0.77; 95% confidence interval = 0.64–0.93), and all-cause death (4.3 vs. 5.8%; hazard ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval = 0.64–0.90). Within the first 10 days, 5366 (48.4%) patients were managed without revascularization. Regardless of revascularization or not, ticagrelor consistently reduced the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.86 vs. 0.85, interaction P = 0.93), and all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.75 vs. 0.73, interaction P = 0.89) with no significant increase in overall major bleeding.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  In patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, benefit of ticagrelor over clopidogrel in reducing ischaemic events and total mortality was consistent with the overall PLATO trial, independent of actually performed revascularization during the initial 10 days.

TITLE: Automated Text Messaging as an Adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: A Clinical Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) for depression is efficacious, but effectiveness is limited when implemented in low-income settings due to engagement difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and early discontinuation of treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching Cognitive Behavioral Therapy skills.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−2.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−1.65, P=.10). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.

Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−1.65, P=.10). ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS.  This study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.
1	5440738	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression with the addition of a text messaging adjunct	Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=−.29, 95% CI −0.38 to −0.19, z=−5.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=−.20, 95% CI −0.32 to −0.07, z=−3.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction.   TITLE: Automated Text Messaging as an Adjunct to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression: A Clinical Trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) for depression is efficacious, but effectiveness is limited when implemented in low-income settings due to engagement difficulties including nonadherence with skill-building homework and early discontinuation of treatment. Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVES.  The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct (mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching Cognitive Behavioral Therapy skills.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=−2.21, P=.03).

TITLE: Low-load resistance training during step-reduction attenuates declines in muscle mass and strength and enhances anabolic sensitivity in older men    ABSTRACT.  Step-reduction (Step-reduction) in older adults results in muscle atrophy and an attenuated rise in postprandial muscle protein synthesis (muscle protein synthesis): anabolic resistance. Knowing that resistance exercise (resistance exercise) can enhance muscle protein synthesis, we examined whether resistance exercise could enhance muscle protein synthesis following 2 weeks of Step-reduction. In addition, as we postulated that Step-reduction may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (citrulline), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying Step-reduction. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects' who had undergone Step-reduction to a loaded condition of Step-reduction plus resistance exercise (Step-reduction + resistance exercise). Thirty older men (70 ± 1 years) underwent 14 days of Step-reduction (<1500 steps/day) with supplementation of either 5 g/day citrulline or glycine placebo. Throughout Step-reduction, subjects performed unilateral low-load resistance exercise thrice weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and postprandial state (20 g whey isolate plus 15 g glycine or as micellar-whey with 5 g citrulline or 15 g glycine, n = 10/group). As muscle protein synthesis was similar after ingestion of either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey + citrulline data related to different dietary groups were collapsed to compare Step-reduction and Step-reduction + resistance exercise legs. Subjects' daily steps were reduced by 80 ± 2% during Step-reduction (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. Myofibrillar FSR was lower (P < 0.0001) in the Step-reduction as compared with the Step-reduction + resistance exercise leg in the postabsorptive (0.026 ± 0.001%/h vs. 0.045 ± 0.001%/h) and postprandial states (0.055 ± 0.002%/h vs. 0.115 ± 0.003%/h). We conclude that low-load resistance exercise, but not supplementation with citrulline, can attenuate the deleterious effects of Step-reduction in aging muscle.

TITLE: Biochemical markers of bone turnover in patients with spinal metastases after resistance training under radiotherapy – a randomized trial    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  To compare the effects of resistance training versus passive physical therapy on bone turnover markers (bone turnover markers) in the metastatic bone during radiation therapy (radiation therapy) in patients with spinal bone metastases. Secondly, to evaluate an association of bone turnover markers to local response, skeletal-related events (skeletal-related events), and number of metastases.   ABSTRACT.METHODS.  In this randomized trial, 60 patients were allocated from September 2011 to March 2013 into one of the two arms: resistance training (Arm A) or passive physical therapy (Arm B) with thirty patients in each arm during radiation therapy. Biochemical markers such as pyridinoline (pyridinoline), desoxy-pyridinoline (desoxy-pyridinoline), bone alkaline phosphatase (bone alkaline phosphatase), total amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), beta-isomer of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) were analyzed at baseline, and three months after radiation therapy.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Mean change values of pyridinoline and CTX-I were significantly lower at 3 months after radiation therapy (p = 0.035 and p = 0.043) in Arm A. Importantly, all markers decreased in both arms, except of pyridinoline and CTX-I in arm B, although significance was not reached for some biomarkers. In arm A, the local response was significantly higher (p = 0.003) and PINP could be identified as a predictor for survivors (OR 0.968, 95%CI 0.938–0.999, p = 0.043). bone alkaline phosphatase (OR 0.974, 95%CI 0.950–0.998, p = 0.034) and PINP (OR 1.025, 95%CI 1.001–1.049, p = 0.044) were related with an avoidance of skeletal-related events.

TITLE: Open-Label Crossover Study of Primaquine and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Adult Thai Subjects    ABSTRACT.  Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is an artemisinin-based combination treatment (artemisinin-based combination treatment) recommended by the WHO for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and it is being used increasingly for resistant vivax malaria where combination with primaquine is required for radical cure. The WHO recently reinforced its recommendations to add a single dose of primaquine to artemisinin-based combination treatments to reduce P. falciparum transmission in low-transmission settings. The pharmacokinetics of primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were evaluated in 16 healthy Thai adult volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Volunteers were randomized to two groups of three sequential hospital admissions to receive 30 mg (base) primaquine, 3 tablets of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (120/960 mg), and the drugs together at the same doses. Blood sampling was performed over 3 days following primaquine and 36 days following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine dosing. Pharmacokinetic assessment was done with a noncompartmental approach. The drugs were well tolerated. There were no statistically significant differences in dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine pharmacokinetics with or without primaquine. This interaction is similar to that described recently with chloroquine and may result in an enhanced radical curative effect.

Blood sampling was performed over 3 days following primaquine and 36 days following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine dosing. Pharmacokinetic assessment was done with a noncompartmental approach. The drugs were well tolerated. There were no statistically significant differences in dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine pharmacokinetics with or without primaquine. This interaction is similar to that described recently with chloroquine and may result in an enhanced radical curative effect.

2	4320136	480 g/day of raw banana for 6 days	Percent iron absorption was significantly higher in raw bananas (49.3±21.3%) compared with cooked banana (33.9±16.2%) (p=0.035). TITLE: Iron absorption in raw and cooked bananas: a field study using stable isotopes in women    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Banana is a staple food in many regions with high iron deficiency and may be a potential vehicle for iron fortification. However, iron absorption from bananas is not known.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  The objective of this study was to evaluate total iron absorption from raw and cooked bananas.   ABSTRACT.DESIGN.  Thirty women (34.9±6.6 years) from rural Mexico were randomly assigned to one of two groups each consuming: 1) 480 g/day of raw banana for 6 days, or 2) 500 g/day of cooked banana for 4 days. Iron absorption was measured after extrinsically labeling with 2 mg of 58Fe and a reference dose of 6 mg 57Fe; analysis was done using ICP-MS.   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  Iron content in cooked bananas was significantly higher than raw bananas (0.53 mg/100 g bananas vs. 0.33 mg/100 mg bananas, respectively) (p<0.001). Total amount of iron absorbed from raw and cooked bananas was similar (0.77±0.33 mg vs. 0.86±0.41 mg, respectively).   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  Total amount of absorbed iron is similar between cooked and raw bananas. The banana matrix does not affect iron absorption and is therefore a potential effective target for genetic modification for iron biofortification.

TITLE: Exploring Immune Development in Infants With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis    ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND.  Atopic dermatitis (Atopic dermatitis) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in infancy with a complex pathology. In adults, the clinical severity of Atopic dermatitis has been associated with increases in T helper cell type (Th) 2, Th22, and Th17 serum markers, including high levels of CC chemokine ligand (CC chemokine ligand) 17 and CCL22 chemokines.   ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE.  To explore the possible association between serum chemokine levels and Atopic dermatitis severity in infants with moderate-to-severe Atopic dermatitis and elevated immunoglobulin E (immunoglobulin E).   ABSTRACT.SUBJECTS AND METHODS.  Serum samples (n = 41) obtained from a randomized, double-blind, and clinical dietary intervention study were used to study biomarkers in infants with Atopic dermatitis. Baseline- and post-intervention samples (4 months) were used, six chemokines and nine ratios thereof were analyzed using Luminex and correlated to Atopic dermatitis severity. In the initial study, the infants were randomized to receive extensively hydrolyzed whey-based formula without (control) or with short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9:1) and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V).   ABSTRACT.RESULTS.  31 Infants up to 11 months of age, with an objective-SCORAD score (objective-SCORAD score) ≥ 20 and elevated total-IgE and/or specific-IgE levels were included. In time, the median objective-SCORAD score decreased in both groups by −8 (control, p < 0.05; and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, p < 0.01). Irrespective of dietary intervention, several changes in Th2 chemokines (CCL17 and CCL22), inflammatory chemokine (CCL20), and the Th1 chemokine, CXC chemokine ligand (CXC chemokine ligand) 9, were detected over time. Overall CCL17 correlated to objective-SCORAD score (r = 0.446, p < 0.01). In addition, a reduction in Th2/Th1 chemokine ratios for CCL17/CXCL9, CCL22/CXCL9, CCL20/CXCL10, and CCL20/CXCL11 was detected associated with the and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V intervention.   ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION.  While this study is small and exploratory in nature, these data contribute to immune biomarker profiling and understanding of Atopic dermatitis in infants.

TITLE: Effect of Probiotic     ABSTRACT.  Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Antibiotic-associated diarrhea) is a common complication of antibiotic use. There is growing interest in probiotics for the treatment of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection because of the wide availability of probiotics. The aim of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was to assess the efficacy of probiotic Lactobacillus (Lacidofil® cap) for the prevention of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults. From September 2008 to November 2009, a total of 214 patients with respiratory tract infection who had begun receiving antibiotics were randomized to receive Lactobacillus (Lacidofil® cap) or placebo for 14 days. Patients recorded bowel frequency and stool consistency daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who developed Antibiotic-associated diarrhea within 14 days of enrollment. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea developed in 4 (3.9%) of 103 patients in the Lactobacillus group and in 8 (7.2%) of 111 patients in the placebo group (P=0.44). Although the Lacidofil® cap does not reduce the rate of occurrence of Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adult patients with respiratory tract infection who have taken antibiotics, the Lactobacillus group maintains their bowel habits to a greater extent than the placebo group.
